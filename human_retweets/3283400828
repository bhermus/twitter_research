#RepeatTheFeatDLSU https://t.co/71a6iNxdctThank you, Kim Dy.
Thank you, Majoy Baron.
Thank you. Dawn Macandili.

This 11th championship is for you. The DLSU community is proud of you. Animo! #RepeatTheFeatDLSU https://t.co/FcaBAzYXkfIt is rare for a libero to get the finals MVP award. But if it is Dawn Macandili, there’s no question about it. 

Very well-deserved. Congrats, Dawn! You proved your haters wrong once again. Animo! #RepeatTheFeatDLSUWhen the list of UAAP individual awardees came out, it’s so funny how a lot of haters started saying Dawn Macandili isn’t graduating with an award and I’m here thinking she’s graduating with a CHAMPIONSHIP. That’s always BETTER than any individual award. #JustSaying ✌🏻💚3-time Champs. 
3 MVPs. 
3 words,

MAHAL KO KAYO. 💚💚💚

Congrats, lodis!!! #UAAPSeason80Volleyball #RepeatTheFeatDLSU
