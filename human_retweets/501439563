They wanna see you do good. But they don’t wanna see you doing better than them.the world doesn't deserve this kid https://t.co/2KPi843yA6Me: yay sundress season
My thighs: bish you thoughtDo you ever miss having someone as a friend even though you know fully well they mistreated you but you get sad thinking about the good times yeah idk 😭I want to see a tour with Nikki Minaj and Cardi BTruly makes me sad that people think and are still taught that in order to lose weight you have to restrict yourself and eat nothing but fish, vegetables and rice.

No No No! You can still enjoy life and transform your health and body.i love airports because rules of society just don’t apply. eat pizza or ice cream while wearing sweatpants at 8 pm or 8 am, no one cares.17yo at our gym trying to build his fitness account asked me how to deal with negativity or “haters.” FUCK EM. That’s how. The sooner you realize you don’t have to give any energy to that, the better off you’ll be. Immediately delete and block. Never feed into it.seriously so thankful my childhood was filled with being outdoors, scraped knees from being adventurous, and having an imagination rather than apps and social media.me???? obsessed w my man??? Absolutelyhaving a man that gives you communication &amp; reassurance is an amazing feeling.Insecure people try and tear others down. Remember that. Don’t let someone else’s insecurities create your own.I'm so glad I didn't give up on myselfWe need to stop caring so deeply about the beliefs entertainers have. We want every celebrity we like to mirror us in our actions and thoughts. When they don’t it becomes a personal offense to us, we feel betrayed.People with lower vibrations are going to be bothered when you start to vibrate higher. Don’t get mad at them - extend empathy to them.I wish that every human could get to experience true happiness and true love. It seems to me like everyone should get to feel that at some point in their life. It would probably solve every single issue we have. It would make a lot of “bad” people good. Love everyone today, kids.I’m surrounded by the best people ahhhh I’m so happy 💛“people leave you out in the cold and then get mad when you learn how to keep yourself warm.” 

this. quote.It’s cool to be kind ✌🏼 https://t.co/z5QPsdGRvai really need to stop assuming people have the same heart i doYou have this one life. How do you wanna spend it? Regretting? Questioning? Apologizing? Hating yourself? Dieting 24/7? Trying to please everybody? Stop. Be brave. Believe in yourself. Do what feels good. Take risks. You have this ONE LIFE. Make your damn self proud.Slowly learning that every situation doesn’t need a reaction.You can literally do everything for someone and they still won’t appreciate it because people suck !!it’s okay to be obsessed with upgrading your life in all aspects. it’s okay to want to be a better woman, all around.Hot Cheetos and cream cheese. I stand by this forever.If you enjoy strict dieting..you go!

If you enjoy macro counting..fantastic!

If you enjoy a keto diet...wonderful!

If you enjoy intuitive dieting..awesome. 

Do what works for you and what you ENJOY!@narda_dorado @katyhearnFit They make fun of you because they know it’s hard work! Much easier for them to make fun of you than do the work themselves! You’ll experience this a lot in life, not just fitness. Stick to it.https://t.co/EVr2gbJYVDHow people don’t like ice cream...will forever be a mystery to me. 🤷🏼‍♀️Forever grateful for the people who help to pick you up when you’re down.If you’re feeling salty towards me or anyone else... take a look at yourself and really ask yourself WHY you feel that way.
People are negative towards you because they are upset with themselves. It’s never you. Keep doing you boo💜💜You can’t be them...and they can’t be you.Did you know...
That if you see something you don’t like on social media....

Not having to guess someone’s feelings or intentionsI’ve always been one to trust my gut and when something feels off or shady..I’m usually right.You set the standard for how people treat you.Everyone always wants quick results when it comes to fitness. It’s taken me 4 YEARS to understand my own body and what works for me. 4 YEARS of trial and error. What works for one person, doesn’t work for others. 4 YEARS is a long time, be patient with yourself, you’re only humanSOMETIMES WHEN YOU SLACKING, THE UNIVERSE CATCHES YOU OFF GUARD AND MAKES THINGS HAPPEN TO MAKE IT SEEM AS IF YOUR LIFE IS FUCKED UP, BUT IT AINT. ISSA WAKEUP CALL FOR YOU TO STOP FOOLING AROUND AND TO GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.It’s ok to feel stressed out, overwhelmed, or like everything is shitty. Things will NOT always be rainbows and butterflies... it’s ok!Honestly the week between Christmas and New Years is a very confusing time for me. Do I get my shit together? Do I just sleep all day? What day is it? Do I have to put clothes on? Someone please explainhaving no phone service this christmas has actually been really nice. you see a lot when you’re not staring at your phone 24/7buzzed driving is still drunk driving!! just a friendly reminder not to drink and drive this holiday season. don’t tear a hole in the heart of the people that love youSome people find a reason to be positive and some find a way to be negative. Recognize that it’s a choice.Fitness is hard bc I can never decide if I want to be a string bean country club lookin wife or a curvy muffuckin woman 🤷🏻‍♀️HAHAHA HOLY SHIT I KEEP THINKING 2017 CANNOT POSSIBLY GET ANY WORSE BUT MAN I WAS WRONG 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 chalking this year up to a loss, there is no redeeming myself at this point 🙂Instead of focusing on weight loss, focus on how you look and feel!! That # can be so deceiving. Detach yourself from it.people wanna see you do good, but never better than them..Being in a relationship where you both mutually respect, support, and appreciate the fk out of each other is seriously cool af.❤️sometimes we win and sometimes we learn. but we never lose. losers lose. eliminate the losers mentalityImagine feeling the need to tell another woman you think she’s ugly... lmao how sad :-( get well soonIf you don’t like the way someone looks in a picture... keep scrolling or unfollow. No one needs your rude ass opinionJust because I don’t agree with your actions or share the same opinion as you..doesn’t mean I stop supporting you as a person/friend.Be strong enough to accept your failures and grow.grocery shopping or running errands with someone is an underrated form of intimacy don't @ meNot everyone is going to agree with everything you say. Listen to them. Get some insight. Perspective is cool even if you don’t agreeAnd LIFE is GROWTH. So in order to live you must grow; and in order to grow you must accept change.i guess all i can do is prayIt’s that type of cold weather where you wake up and your tits look phenomenalI fucking love my momWhat a gorgeous day. Tough times never last. Tough people do tho. They last. 💪🏽Self doubt, insecurity, uncertainty, etc. are all horrible feelings. Even those who are the most confident can/will feel them. You got this.Honestly lol at the fact that when I was a kid I thought people in their 20s had it together 😂😂😂 NOPEIf I can be completely silent around you without you asking me what’s wrong, ilyIt truly baffles me how some women have such a hard time complimenting other women.Don't you dare avoid being seen or showing up because you're scared of what people will say or think about you. Stand proud.Girls who are both chill and kind hearted are my fkn favoriteBeing in love feels so damn goodIdk how to talk about my struggles without coming across as whiney or attention seeking so most of the time I just say nothing at all.I don’t know why I’m nice to people who don’t deserve it but that that’s just who I am and I don’t think I’d ever change thatMe while @ the gym: I just want to be lean and shredded and HOTTTT

Me not @ gym: I want to wear hoodies and drink wine and eat everythingDid ya know that the way you think is the biggest determinant of your success?Start praying for the person you don’t want to forgive. 

Start blessing the person that makes you bitter.Feeling appreciated is such a high for me.You don't need to change. The diet and fitness industry does. All you need to be is healthy and happy.I literally cut myself off in the middle of negative thoughts like bitch we don't have time for this come back .RT if you'd rather have a man that's secure enough in his masculinity to show honest emotion than a "macho" chump who bottles everything upI saw something I didn't agree with on twitter and I kept scrolling: a concept.Learning exactly who you are and what gives / drains you of energy will allow you to be more at peace with your decisions.Today might be a good day to commit a selfless act of kindness for someone else.Ideal date night:
Movie
Froyo
Grocery shoppingreally wish i enjoyed doing cardio as much as i love lifting and eating food🤷🏼‍♀️You mostly likely will never grow a booty if ur only eating 1200 calories a day, sorrythese past few years i learned how easy it is to lose yourself.and i learned the hard way but aye.... i'm back on my shit.Little things don’t mean a lot.... they mean everything.I can't stress enough how important communication is like so many issues would be avoided if people just fkn talked to each other openlyGod will send you signs, pay attention.I'm pretty stupid but I am constantly reminded that most people are even more stupid than I amSometimes losing the thing we think we need the most allow us to grow the most.Exercising regularly, eating well, drinking water, and sleeping enough really does work wonders lolSure you can want to change the past but would you be the amazing human you are if you didn't experience &amp; fight thru what made u stronger?@katyhearnFit @HaydnSchneider i just found this quote I wrote down when a situation like urs occurred last yr &amp; it made me think of yall! 💙 https://t.co/f3Qtev84rX@kenziebrenna Would you be the amazingly positive and contributing person that you are today without those mistakes? Personally, I wouldn't have been.Growth and comfort are rarely companions!Compliment other people. Lift other people up. Root for other people. Magnify their strengths. Clap for them. Being a good person is fun.Making fun of people for doing cool things for themselves discourages people from doing cool things for themselves*Thread*
Cardio for fat loss. This is going to be a pretty detailed one.Glute development with virtually no quad or hamstring development... sounds fake but ok https://t.co/pBIpFFuaCrCan't nobody stop what God got for you...Ya'll shame natural bodies but praise fake ones 🤷🏽‍♀️date a boy who works hard, loves his momma, loves dogs, and sings in the car with uLove &gt;There's nothing wrong w/ wanting more. But as soon as you start getting discouraged w/ where ur at, its time to stop &amp; see how far u've comeEveryone's version of "fit" looks different. All I care about for my clients is that they're strong,happy, and healthyPSA: https://t.co/MzFFnOCuCB
