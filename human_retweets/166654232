#actionalert https://t.co/8ykA6BF6XqTo the Philly District Attorney’s office, I’m grateful for your commitment to justice. I understand that many people of color across the country don’t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues.I’d like to thank God, my family, and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time. While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive.Gracias @MNYouthCouncil for holding hearing on this bill &amp; asking me to testify today along w/ @MinnCLA @CAPMnews our state’s Latino &amp; Asian councils

Nah, this type of stuff rarely happens to non-Black people. 😒 https://t.co/kvnY9Mz5KY#Cowboys made the Romo decision based on hype, attention, and a chance to be cheap at the position. No other team, no matter how the pundits were talking, would let alone bench a Top 5 QB for a rook. Then they cut the Top 5 QB. #awfulWould’ve loved to line up with ya man but God have bigger plans. Go ball out fam https://t.co/U4zCtaW0eUI will not be wearing 88, they might as well retire that number.Cowboy nation I need you to know this wasn’t my decision..

Asking for a friend... @CGBYRD42 #SlowGrindThank you, @SophiaBush ✊🏾 https://t.co/FbU7qdgxd3I guess a white man dressed in body armor carrying a fully loaded weapon doesn't make an officer 'fear for his life' as much as a black man carrying his cell phone. Noted. https://t.co/0PcZ2IXmqfCan’t stop thinking about the great meeting with @MNYouthCouncil last night. Such inspiring leaders!
