#FeelGoodShowtimebecause sometimes you don't get a second chance #FeelGoodShowtimeIf you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.

You don't need to bash and just be happy,
Showtime will make us HAPPY.

#FeelGoodShowtimeProblem with girls; they love someone too much. Problem with boys; they let go too easily. 

#FeelGoodShowtimeWhen a girl is happy, she doesn't stop talking. #FeelGoodShowtimeStop getting attached to people so fast, because attachments lead to expectations and expectations lead to disappointments
#FeelGoodShowtimeThe tension keeps on building up  #FeelGoodShowtimeThat awkward moment wen u realize ur walking in d wrong direction, so u hit your pockets pretending you forgot something. #FeelGoodShowtime#FeelGoodShowtime ignore their tweets even if its million, let just mind our own tweets for Positive VibesI DO LOVE you ..haha @vicegandako  @anakarylle
