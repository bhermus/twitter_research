No All-Stars. They were 9 GMs under .500 in late Jan. Didn’t have Gobert for almost a third of their season. And now going toe-to-toe with arguably the favorites in the West and Harden.

But how long can he stay in OKC? That loyalty will prevent him from ever wining a championship. He's 30 in November.There is a clear difference in the way that OKC is scoring and the way that Utah is scoring... I got no clue why OKC continues to play like this......the only hope they have is to catch fire on hero shots@IAmJayJones + @JLawbball  teaming up. Stay tuned for more videos, tips, and behind-the-scenes footage of their workout. https://t.co/AtLYNo5iZQThat game changed hoops history.It’s why OKC lost game 6 of the 2016 WCF. He let Klay get hot by not sticking with him/losing him/roaming. Once he got going it was a wrap. https://t.co/sMW07yhVAmI bought $3 mink lashes?!

Multiple head pats, grabbed his jersey as if to say, you've arrived, kidbahhahahahah watch Lance after Oladipo’s 3 https://t.co/YCMwf64PRNLeBron James is the NBA's all-time leader in playoff scoring with 6261 points. A record that will likely never be broken. Next closest active player is Tony Parker: 4032.Jordan Clarkson has the hot hand! 🔥

He's 5 for 5 from the field for 12 PTS.

There's a lot of teams in the league right now, especially in the East, that could see success and gain instant buzz if they build around Isaiah Thomas. https://t.co/Lv3mw4iSGlBron about to take everyone’s suits back.Mike Breen just said that Lance Stephenson told the media that LeBron never responds to his trash talk, except for one time he responded and looked at Lance and said:
