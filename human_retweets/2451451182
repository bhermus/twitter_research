Amen. 🙏👆Love is made up of efforts in trusting each other.People change but memories don't.Texting is fine, calling is okay. But being with you is the best.Trust me bro, she loves it when she can hold on to your phone. She loves it when she opens your phone and all she sees is her selfies saved all over your camera roll. She loves it even more when she's on your wallpaper.God has your back when no one else does."When I miss you, it's like every song I listen to is about you."We cannot learn without experiencing pain.Live more.
