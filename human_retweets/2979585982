Hammy, anyone? ☄️ https://t.co/TY4CjVcEo3Unless there something wrong with your eyesight, don’t wear sunglasses indoors. It makes you look like a douche bag.Feel like I need some good Karma heading back to Augusta haha. RT this and I'll give away my favorite @TaylorMadeGolf driving iron to one lucky winner.The Browns new players got together for a little workout today 👀#MakeTheBrownsGreatAgain https://t.co/PoYXcPGqrHSamuel left cracker crumbs all over my car so I’m eating a Nature Valley granola bar over his crib.Samuel sits on Catherine’s lap and farts and it’s the cutest thing ever. I try it once and I’m “disgusting”. Nothing about this is fair.Catherine asked me to move a bookshelf in the baby’s room. In its place, she put a giant teddy bear. I told her that without the bookshelf, the wall looked a little “bear”. 

I think I’m slowly breaking her will.I know 31 teams that did not finish the season with the “Tittle” in hand but I only care about one. #ClevelandBrowns #MentalityTiger provided the most compelling TV drama over the last 20 years. Kids who watched him quit basketball, baseball and football because they wanted to be like him. Now he’s facing competition that he literally created. What a sport.OK, playtime is over.

I’m doing what I have to do to not be an asshole anymore. You should try it, life’s better on this side https://t.co/vmtqWLdxZNIf the Browns can figure out a way to announce they are going back to the old uniforms today... they will be 2018 Super Bowl champs.Koby Altman running the Browns too?My 9 year old came running up the stairs asking “Who won?” and I had to explain to him that this is not a game show and those of us that win really only get a minivan, a wife, children, and a neil lane ring (not necessarily in that order) #thebachelorI just won an Oscar. WTF?!?.@kobebryant: Oscar winner. https://t.co/gbtIWebs3m31 days to go.

- way more nudity than expected
- smart idea to do it all as a rap
- Charlie Sheen totally holds his own
- Adam Driver's love ballad felt awkward
- didn't like the 22-minute Olaf short 
- Smash Mouth's "All Star" was a bold end-credits choiceSo who do I talk to about a Cap/Human Torch buddy comedy spin-off?

Best QB to ever play for the Bucks, so let's not forget &amp; start point fingersThis is three offensive coordinators in a row who seem to run the QB more than the RBs in games like this. That's a curious coincidence.Isaiah Thomas is ready to ball in Cleveland. https://t.co/P7nNAyoZTkIsaiah says LeBron has reached out to him and is excited about this team.."I'm excited to play here..it's a match made in heaven"Crowder on the trade &amp; loss of his mother all at once: I was just glad I got to whisper in her ear right before: we're going to Cleveland.Sharp. 🔥🔥🔥
