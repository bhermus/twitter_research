Forgiveness is a choice, not a feeling.
Forgiveness doesn't require an apology.
Forgiveness acknowledges what's been taken.
Forgiveness cancels the debt and credits the account.
Forgiveness trusts God with the future.

Having students reflect RIGHT AFTER learning is key to authentic metacognition. Add it to the portfolio later!
