If you’ve left any rubbish on the beach at Barry Island today then you should be ashamed of yourself.  Disgusting. https://t.co/veht462twdThis week, whether you play for @cardiff_blues , work there or are a relative, whether you’ve supported the team all your life or just for a while... we join together, believe together and cheer on our boys in the @ERChallengeCup Final. Let’s do this!! #Bilbao2018 💙 #bringithomeIt’s tremendous for the city of Cardiff, and its commuter towns, for premiership soccer to be back next season. With the city of Cardiff also awarded a Twenty20 “franchise thing”, there’s a good bandwagon of pro elite sport beginning to trundle along.@cardbluesbruvas @theArmsPark @accrfc. Bilbao Flag sorted!!! 💪🤙 https://t.co/gFUp8D2sr8Join Cardiff Blues in Bilbao! https://t.co/qbfHnfDgki https://t.co/JrSunrx4uoWales and Lions No 8 Taulupe Faletau has signed a long-term contract extension with Bath, ending hopes of him rejoining the Dragons next year.I am told that with the new TV deals, the total @PRO14Official income - taking in TV, sponsors and events - will be more than double what it was three years ago. You have to take your hat off to managing director @TinoAnayi for delivering the goods.Just want to share an DM what I receive from @PRO14Official yesterday. 

Seems my efforts did by go unnoticed

👍👍👊👊 https://t.co/h34CJ2tzBWSorry @dorianlj10 it’s too good not to share 😂😂 https://t.co/KO2EltcQKXWales set to play Spain at the Principality Stadium in October. Talks between FAW/WRU have proved positive and, barring any last-minute hitches, the friendly will be Wales' first game at the 74,500-seater stadium since 2011.Demand for the Home Challenge Cup HQ at CAP is excellent! The more people who register, the better the event will be.. current working plan is outdoor event with a big screen, food and bars available. Please register your interest ASAP if you haven’t already done so!Jérome Garcès will take charge of the #ChallengeCup final between @Cardiff_Blues and @GloucesterRugby at the San Mamés Stadium on Friday, 11 May. https://t.co/dwVHDEm6yxI’ve been doing my best to stay positive about Macron, but they don’t half make it difficult when they’re producing rubbish like that Scarlets quarter-final t-shirt.3⃣0⃣ - @cardiff_blues' @ollyrobbo and @BradThyer each made 30 tackles against the Ospreys, only one player has made more in a @PRO14Official match since Opta began recording this data in 2010/11 (Josh van der Flier v Connacht, January 2018). Busy.I understand the total PRO14 TV deal from next season will bring in more than £30m, which is a big uplift from a year or so ago. One game a week live on FreeSports plus a highlights show. Discussions ongoing with S4C. https://t.co/UcAjfL9wYO#MerciArsène https://t.co/w6VH6hkQNoIf Rhys Webb is fit, why didn’t we give him game time today @ospreys I know he’s going but surely he has to play against Ulster?? You’re not just cutting off your nose to spite your face, you’re cutting off the noses of supporters who pay to watch the best available squad!Surely the WRU and the host regions need to listen to the feedback about Judgement Day from week-in, week-out fans? Ignore me fine, listen to them.Anyone who doubts this guys ability, needs to give their head a shake. ⬇️ https://t.co/bA0BRbDC74If that was Taufa'ao Filise's last appearance in Cardiff then a HUGE thank you for your incredible service to @cardiff_blues. https://t.co/4dl8k5FlmYWales and Scarlets star launches astonishing post-match attack on the Dragons https://t.co/vGpEUnfR8OAnyone who doubts Gareth Anscombe’s ability after today really does need to have a look at themselves; brilliant #CBLvOSPHope that win kicks Ospreys on into their play-off, be superb to get three Welsh teams in the Champions Cup next season.Every game in a @cardiff_blues shirt is one to be grateful for, but sharing the field with this guy  always makes it a special one #KingOfTonga https://t.co/YYE7F7PR93If someone had told me we’d lead for much of the game and lose by just three points, while blooding a load of youngsters and performing so well in defence, with the team we put out I’d have been fucking chuffed. Fantastic @cardiff_blues 👏🏻👏🏻🔵🔵On our way to Judgement Day ..... sigh. Oh for an afternoon at CAP.We’re off to #Bilbao 
We’re off to Bilbao,
You’re off to Belfast 
We’re off to Bilbao! 

#COYBIB #JudgementDayVI #JDVI #CBLvOSP #CARvOSPThose criticising @cardiff_blues #JDVI selection need their heads examined. That is still a strong team out there today. 

“Showpiece event” - irrelevant.

We have bigger fish to fry. We just can’t risk an injury for a Cup final that means so much to players and fans.The university side were booted out of the competition https://t.co/JR5ZlNSXBnGood luck to my @cardiff_blues brothers today. Let’s go out and show the strength of our squad.. Let’s get behind the WHOLE blues squad 🔵🔵🔵#judgmentDayRepeatSeems to have been a jaw-dropping £300bn swing in foreign investment flows to and from UK, in a negative sense, between 2016 and 2017 according to latest OECD figures. Nothing to do with Brexit, of courseBig shout out to Rey Lee-Lo of @cardiff_blues who came and trained with me and Mountain Ash RFC U9’s this evening, absolute gent of a guy and got involved with the boys in all the games this evening.
