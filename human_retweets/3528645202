WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? https://t.co/YJfHhpH3rWTo: All of my Snapchat followers

It was a honor having you watch my snaps daily. I also want to thank you for allowing me to watch or tap thru yours. However, due to an unnecessary update, I would like to decommit from Snapchat. I wish you all the best.Dear social media apps:
PLEASE STOP MESSING WITH CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. We live our lives chronologically, so when it jumps all over the place, it's really frustrating.
I get it, you want to make money. We all do. Find another way other to do it.
Sincerely,
Every person online evercompared to last year, this show is incredible. our best run last year doesn’t even compare to this, i can’t wait.1 million retweets and I’ll eat a gluestick@alishas_wonder 😘 memes make the world go-roundSnapchat ruined itself, Instagram is plastered with videos, Facebook is a 35 and above club, but you Twitter my friend, have killed it
