This isn’t even an argument https://t.co/BZHpIW1RhIFor the rest of 2018 &amp; beyond I’m not:
• Listening to people talk about the same problems when I’ve already gave them solutions.
• Trying to be the voice of reason. 
• Sugarcoating anything.
• Being cordial to people I don’t care for.I don't get MAD easily.. I get annoyed easily. Understand the difference.My walk is different, My talk is different , My vibe is different , My perspective is different.
