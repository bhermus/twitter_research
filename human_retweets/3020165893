It‚Äôs the best looking game on PS4 and has my favorite game story in years, but it also feels SO good to play. I never got sick of the combat or puzzles, and it‚Äôs overwhelming in the best way how much there is to do and explore. What a gem üôåüèª https://t.co/7vKKb2F55ochildren's horror or family friendly horror is my absolute favorite genre, especially animation. I personally think you find the most creativity in this genre because they are forced to be creative without relying on gore or shock value. (I love adult horror too though!) https://t.co/1APTjhWbmNHappy Birthday to Shirley Walker who composed the theme for Superman: TAS.
Thank you Shirley.
