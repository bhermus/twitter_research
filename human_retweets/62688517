FINAL: #Angels 8, Mariners 2. The Halos take the series against Seattle as Ohtani picks up his third win of the season while the offense logs three home runs! https://t.co/EDK3cSJjAh#SundayFunday 😎✅
#LTBU https://t.co/ktonsTQlVeWelcome to the club, @PujolsFive! 

#TipOfTheCap https://t.co/etlbQ4IBLq"It was a great moment. I knew as soon as I hit that ball, I knew it was going to drop."

@PujolsFive joined #MLBTonight to talk about his 3000th career hit. @Angels #Pujols3K https://t.co/jycon4MVYRWhen I think of Albert Pujols, I think of a man that is a leader, a man of faith and not afraid to share his belief, a man who cares for others, and a man who pounds a baseball unlike anyone else. #RE5PECTCongrats @PujolsFive!!  What an amazing accomplishment!  #3000There’s only one Albert Pujols. The field and the game wouldn’t be the same without you.

3000 and COUNTING!! #MACHINE https://t.co/W0W7pMnHJk.@PujolsFive is the 2nd player to reach the 3,000-hit mark in an @Angels uniform (Rod Carew, 8/4/85). #Pujols3k https://t.co/tAPTH8fpJWCongrats @PujolsFive #3000 hits what a accomplishment! Much love AP.@PujolsFive has been doing legendary things for the better part of two decades. #Pujols3k https://t.co/JHswAQVBivNow that's one big happy family #Pujols3000 https://t.co/EpuiRrF09D#HaloRecap:

@PujolsFive has a historical night as he becomes the 32nd member of the 3,000 hit club while @GRICHARDS26 and the #Angels shut out the Mariners,
https://t.co/6SJsHzyj50 https://t.co/wgh7Dgd6NiThe 3,000 Hit Club just got bigger! Albert Pujols, you’re its newest member! #Pujols3000 https://t.co/hatWVJblgaCongrats @PujolsFive! That is a very special accomplishment! #3000hits@PujolsFive has made it to where baseball fans have been able to witness history over and over again. Always proud to be a fan but it's these moments that make baseball such an incredible game and pastime. Congratulations, Albert! ⚾ #3000 #Angels #HalosRecap#LTBUThank you God for all that you’ve done &amp; continue to do 🙌🏾🙏🏾 #NationalDayOfPrayer🎶Now walk it out. Now walk it out.🎶 https://t.co/vG9YGm03e7#LightUpTheHalo!

The high fives are always sweeter after a walkoff win! https://t.co/F5vVDSX0bCLTBU! Needed this one!! No quit!! https://t.co/JUYKJF3IvU@AnaheimSports1 @Agls_art @espn My favorite was this...
“Is there anything more annoying if you’re an Angel fan and your hear that at your own ballpark?”

UH YEAAAAAAAA.....

But not NEARLY as annoying as JERKY ANNOUNCERS WHO ARE EXTREMELY BIASED.....    #ESPNSUCKSNot loving the #FS1 broadcast tonight, the game is rough enough...need some @Markgubicza to lighten the mood! https://t.co/48K5qTm1ZRMy wish for Albert Pujols. When he gets to 2,999 hits. If it’s on the road, that he is immediately pulled from the game. This is a record that needs to be completed at home. In front of our fans. So we can give Albert the appreciation he deserves.#LTBU Angels win 7 in a row!!!! https://t.co/iQuLcD5tK1#LTBU.@MikeTrout autograph ✔️
