Monday night is podcast night all over the internet. Here's @LekDogSC and I attempting to make a podcast that doesn't involve shouting. 

Spoiler alert, it involves a lot of shouting. 

https://t.co/EEgFEdCY0IDangerfield has had a 40-60 (Mid-Fwd) split in his past three games. #AFLFantasyLuke Shuey is done for the day after injuring his right hamstring just 3 minutes into the game. 
Who needs to step up for @WestCoastEagles to win now? #AFLEaglesPower@westernbulldogs @GoldCoastSUNS Bontempelli withdrawn due to a sore hip, according to Dogs CEO (via @1116sen).Either Banfield or O'Meara are leaving for Mclean this week. 
Anyone care to speculate on what O'Meara scores this week? I can keep him, or trade him and either loop Holman/Banfield for M8, or trade Banfield for a 550k premo. 

@cbe919 @Doctor_SC @FatherDougalSCT @BarronVonCrowWhat's going on with Danger? Are you taking a VC from last night? What trades are you looking at? Let's talk #supercoach
https://t.co/hdX3VSphN9Have 840k for upgrades, should i double upgrade this week or go 1 up and cole? Should i focus on midfield (macrae/jelwood/zerrett) or my fwd and back lines? And who should i be trading out?

Cheers again
