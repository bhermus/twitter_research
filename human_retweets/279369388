‚ñ™Ô∏èCohen routinely paid hush money for Trump.
‚ñ™Ô∏èTrump hired spies to target Obama officials.
‚ñ™Ô∏èTrump moved HUGE sums of cash around the world.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCohen ran what can only be described as a money-laundering operation.

Mr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied. This followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen. This should never be acceptable in our America. We will not rest until justice is served. #basta1/2. We predicted months ago that it would be proven that the American people had been lied to as to the $130k payment and what Mr. Trump knew, when he knew it and what he did in connection with it. Every American, regardless of their politics, should be outraged...Just asked @MichaelAvenatti to react to Rudy comments about Trump paying back Cohen on Stormy $:

‚ÄúI am stunned and speechless. If this is accurate, the American people have been lied to and deceived for months. And justice must be served.‚ÄùRemarkable: Hannity tries to give Rudy opportunity to clean up comment Trump reimbursed him for Stormy payment. But Rudy insists: ‚ÄúI was talking about the $130K payment ... That was money paid by his lawyer ... and the president had reimbursed him over a period of several months‚ÄùRudy Giuliani just told Fox that Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen the $130,000 for the Stormy Daniels agreement.Stupid.

Trump's mafia and Kremlin ties go back decades. If not investigated -- why?

#ComeyInterviewThis is one of those headlines that's going to look pretty silly as Trump finishes out his term and maybe even wins re-election. https://t.co/c9QQzeWxvaAnyway, am I saying that nothing matters and there‚Äôs no reason to try? No. No, absolutely not.

What I‚Äôm saying is not to count your eggs before they hatch, to fight against harmful policies, elect politicians who share your worldview, kick ass and take names at the ballot box.What does the sloppines and misleadingness of Trump &amp; team on small things (here using a photo from a different mtng bc/ nobody noticed Pence presence was a giveaway) foretell abt their shoddiness and lack of credibility on the big things? https://t.co/GS0bzrGko0Yeah, so here‚Äôs the Trumpist (on the right) who put in his mind that it was a good idea to wear "America 1st" trunks with a #BuildTheWall design against Mexican fighter Francisco Vargas. Mission Accomplished, Tex. https://t.co/GeOiw01twACable news isn't talking about Michael Cohen at all. Mission Accomplished, indeed.How revealing that a @Starbucks employee, who works in a place where people spend hours sitting around using the wifi and tapping away on their laptops with or without coffee, gets alarmed enough to call the cops just because black men enter the space and don‚Äôt order right away. https://t.co/pdzXYfMc09Tapper‚Äôs face in the fourth panel gives me life https://t.co/WH7nME6QclOn the day Bush was on the USS Lincoln with the Mission Accomplished sign, I was in Baghdad, standing outside the Republican Palace hoping to talk to the Americans in charge. 

I couldn't. There weren't Americans in charge.

He's 91 and his health is failing. He told his tale of survival for 65 years. Now, I've taken the responsibility.

One part of his story always gets a big reaction from students. https://t.co/SO5QrPWwklwe could welcome in every syrian refugee and give them all an income and a house and food for less than this is going to cost, AND we'd actually stick it to their shitty government instead of just giving them a reason to keep fucking with their citizensWe don't want these innocents to be murdered with chemical weapons, so we're murdering them with bombsOh we see, Donald.
