If 100 people lived on earth. https://t.co/390X322tYU68% of Leavers will only accept Brexit if it doesn't affect their personal income.

Chaps, listen. The BEST CASE is it'll cost £615 million a week.

That's £88 per household per month. Equivalent to a 13% tax increase if you're on the average wage.

They lied to you. Sorry.I hate customer service lines that ALWAYS say, every time you ring (at any time in the day)... "sorry we are experiencing unusual call volumes".

No! You are experiencing normal call volumes you just don't resource your helpline adequately.It's called banter you click baiters. https://t.co/ew4rYXgzkxIt’s all over in east London - and #AFCU23 are your new @PLYouth champions!

Sure. 
 
Classic @JordanNobbs8 🤩 https://t.co/QEtweS1nXZThe BBC are introducing a 50:50 gender quota on the experts they have on their shows. How demeaning. I would never want to be asked on a show because of my gender. I want to be asked on because of my knowledge and ability to present ideas.Our family. Always. #DocForever 💙 https://t.co/Q1vrUNEXbMSo are TV cameras #SAvAUS https://t.co/jFAto961fi🎵🎺

Steve Smith is an Aussie
He wears a baggy cap
And when he saw some sticky tape
He said I'm having that...
He gave it Cameron Bancroft
Who rubbed it on the ball
Those cheating Aussie convicts
They'll never change at all!

@ArsenalWFC 1-0 @ManCityWomen https://t.co/ORbJoUYmhp@Carra23 Disgusting, what sort of example are you setting? If a player had done it on the pitch you would have slaughtered them!!!! 🤐If Ox plays shit he is referred to as ‘Arsenal OX’ if he plays well then ‘Liverpool’s OX’. Truth is he hasn’t changed much yet since joining Liverpool https://t.co/Vo8ebrFU8CNever mind VAR, I can't work out how the old EYE system didn't catch that Vertonghen foul on Douglas CostaThis is the most frustrating gif I've ever seen in my life https://t.co/Cgw0wEdgZVSeems to be an awful lot of people missing the point, sometimes it’s not what you say it’s the way that you say it. Genuine terms of endearment are lovely but the ‘scuse me darling’ was just condescending. He can’t say I didn’t warn him 😂#FFSIf Wenger truly loves #afc, which he undoubtedly does, then he will do what is best for the Club and that is resign. He once lifted Arsenal up. Now he's dragging them down with his stubbornness, failure to recruit leaders &amp; inability to organise them defensively. It's time to go.The worst part of having a cold is when you put moisturiser on a sore nose😭😭Cricket, rugby union, rugby league, NFL - you can HEAR either the officials or the video ref. What the hell do they say to each other in football that demands secrecy? #TOTROC #VARI’m on the war path. https://t.co/A3zC6yTB6GWest Brom determined to ruin #Giroud's good looks here.

Nearly HT so he can sort his hair out then 🤣😂🤣

Hate to see Giroud go, but if it's inevitable, then I'd want him to go to Dortmund to help seal the Aubameyang deal!

Rules: https://t.co/mQNfCeAdNY https://t.co/8gAanIXfNdThat’s a penalty!#cojones https://t.co/lyG7outxhd'Champions of England, you'll never sing that', sing the Chelsea fans to Huddersfield who won their first league title 31 years before ChelseaReplays show Lacazette was caught by Yoshida. No appeals for a penalty when there was a clear case for one. Why we don't appeal? #COYG #Arsenal #SOUARS #afcA whole nation is proud of what you have done at #RLWC2017 https://t.co/iGivXINE7BCaught up with MOTD2. Has to be the biggest misrepresentation of any game I've ever seen.

No mention of Bellerin pen, only 3 AFC shots of 17 shown. 7 of Burnleys 8 shots shown.

Starting to enjoy the saltiness if I'm honest.And it always will be 🔴
