Comparison has been hurting u for too long. It's time to appreciate yourself.You will 🙌🏻 https://t.co/ZLXBgAqHp6“I love you still and I always will. - @pauljasonklein” 💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭 RT IF YOUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN LIKE OURS. https://t.co/ETItqIFRKjFind the good. It's all around you. Find it, showcase it &amp; you'll start believing in it. -Jesse Owensi think this is the real three word phrase that best demonstrates true love:

He did it all for you so you never have to prove yourself or feel unloved 😭❤️bad news: a lot can change in a year.

Listen: you're loved, you're worthy of love &amp; respect, &amp; you can be loved even on the days when you see nothing in yourself to love. —rickgrimesbabyface

the moon that witnessed the birth of athens,
the moon that lit blackened cities in 1945,
the moon audrey hepburn sang to in 1960,
the moon van gogh painted,
and somewhere in this world,
underneath the moon,
you.....❤️ #tbt 👫 https://t.co/CEQoJYxLoHJamie + Landon, 16 years ago, A Walk to Remember ❤️. #TBT https://t.co/f0IkmqVDmOAno, alagaan ang sarili g?Having a birthday party without the celebrant sounds silly.
