I’ve been in bed all day 😋yellow is such a dope color, reminds me of sunshine and happiness and sunflowers and lemonade 🌼🍯💛🍋🌟🔆🐝☀️🌻🐣Miss the old daysFrom “come over” to “come home” is a real relationship Goal for mepsa: 

if you’re thinking about allowing someone back into ur life based on the history u two have, DON’T. tuck those memories away and be sad as long as u need to rather than risking ur mental stability for a temporary feeling that comes and goes. lesson learned.a nigga gone ALWAYS end up needing the girl he hurt🤷🏽‍♀️People would rather stop speaking to you instead of apologizing to you when they're wrong, and that's immature af. No shade but there's a few people I'm glad I'm not close to anymore. I lost money and friends, I just want my money back.You never realize how fast time passes until bills are duerelationship goal: for “come over” to turn into “come home”old friends b da biggest haters like sis you use to b allll for me 😂if my mouth don’t say it, my face definitely will.Here’s a vine thread because I’m bored and can’t sleep 🤦🏻‍♀️😂Don’t sit on my bed with your outside clothes on.I use to be a pyscho ass gf. But then I stopped.
