If you outlaw abortions, they will just happen illegally.

But if you outlaw guns, we will all be safe from gun crimes.Kneeling would have been significantly less offensive https://t.co/pUAwjjI8CNJust like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!That's funny, I spoke to CNN for 15 mins yesterday about proactive solutions to prevent gun violence (like passing the Grassley-Cruz bill—which Dems filibustered—that would add $300 million for school safety) yet CNN has aired NONE of it.  Why not air the (entire) interview? https://t.co/c4GZcqTbs7Right, because you’re also not Native American https://t.co/cXi5MR1q60Working on your outer appearance without working on your inner self is like watering a plant at its leaves and not its roots 🥀I think I found my new hobby https://t.co/PAYMRM7wXzAyo good morning Logang wass poppin https://t.co/drUPYojp6K@JoeGiglioSports Uhh yes.. is this Jeff Fisher?
