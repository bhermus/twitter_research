"Socialized medicine" has given Alfie the very best of constant, high-tech care for nearly 2 years for free. The kind of care that would bankrupt most ordinary Americans.

Dear God, these American vultures are contemptible. https://t.co/JcOGTX9WDIUCLan named winner in the internationalisation category  of The Guardian University Awards 2018 for hosting the American University of the Caribbean  @aucmed   @GdnHigherEd #GdnUniAwards Read the full story: https://t.co/TEhT9tX4lYWith the blessing of his family, we are calling on our followers to #FinishForMatt, and run 3.7 miles this week, in memory of Matt Campbell.

https://t.co/8dKlDTVcG8Here is a video of a cat sneezing https://t.co/5CLWVFQhHpYou know who we still haven't heard from about #Windrush? Philomena Cunk. #CunkonBritain https://t.co/FgwUDT3ebQHome Secretary, you are mistaken. The Windrush children were British citizens when we invited them here 70 years ago, as a direct result of colonialism and empire. Their British citizenship is theirs by right and is not something that your Govnt is now choosing to ‘offer’ them. https://t.co/tQCLa0K5GFI have just received a letter telling me to be “grateful” as a black man for all “we have done for those black people who came to live here” or “go back to where ever you came from”. I was born in the Whittington Hospital the son of Windrush migrants. And I will speak for them. https://t.co/WkCeDpLQPfA third #RoyalBaby?
