University of Florida apologizes after graduates aggressively dragged off stage while receiving diplomas. @VictorOquendo has the latest: https://t.co/gabCMLBnWn https://t.co/TGHOMlwNM6Last week there was a Nazi rally in GA, and today a Black man was found hanging from the MLK Drive Bridge (look at the symbolism) in Atlanta. Police there are ruling it a suicide. 
THESE ARE NOT SUICIDES! https://t.co/jby4YSSJ1nNipsey Hussle is working on a documentary that will narrate Dr. Sebi‚Äôs Trial in 1985. 

Dr. Sebi claimed in a New York newspaper ad that he could cure AIDS &amp; was allegedly executed by way of U.S. Medical Corporations because his AIDS remedy would take away from their own profits. https://t.co/jxoCqzknEw"These are our heroes" - @nasMeet James Shaw, Jr. - the hero who single handedly tackled and disarmed the mass shooter at the Waffle House in Tennessee. 

This man put his body on the line, snatched the AR-15 away from him, and saved so many lives.
