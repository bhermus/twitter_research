Everyone who makes Du'aa will receive a response. Either it will be hastened for him in this world, or stored up for him in hereafter.• Hasan Al-Basree said:

“O Son of Adam! Walk on the earth with your feet as long as you wish, for it shall soon be your grave. You have not ceased to subtract from your life span since you came from your mothers’ womb.”

• Al-Hasan al-Basrī, Az-Zuhd, p. 197When blessings come our way, don't become arrogant &amp; boastful. Allah has the power to give blessings &amp; take them away too. Always be humble!Purity is half of faith. 
Alhamdulillah fills the scale. 
Subhanallah &amp; Alhamdulillah fill that which is between heaven &amp; earth.
[Muslim]You may have wronged a million times, but what Allah needs from you is Tawbah. His doors of mercy is always open for you.Surely the most fortunate is he who doesn’t forget the hereafter for this temporary world and doesn’t sacrifice the hereafter for this world.
