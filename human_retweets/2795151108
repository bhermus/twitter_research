1. Don’t have slut friends that you know would  hurt you if given the chance 
2. Trust your mama, 99% she’s right about the people around you  
3. Don’t stay with someone that is cheating on you because it’s convenient, there’s better people out there.I got options but i want who i want 🤷🏽‍♀️remember when we were 13 and wore lulu yoga pants tucked into our socks and a hollister hoodie texting our friends on our blackberries hoping our crushes would call us a rocket one dayi remember when i was younger, my biggest worry was that i would never get a bf bc ppl wouldn’t let me forget that i had a big nose lol.. i think that even at such a young age, that fucked up my self image in the long run. kids are cruel. bullying is fucked.canceling plans is ok. staying home to cook is ok. disappearing for a bit to get your life together is ok. resurfacing in a foreign country with a new name 10 years later is ok. it's called self careLiterally need attention 24/7 where u atNever gets old 😂 https://t.co/mcsu58gjlCWhy tf do people send streak when you DONT even have a streak..In 2018 we hot boxing our rooms with lavender scented essential oils and getting 10 hours of uninterrupted sleepPole dancing is ART and actually takes so much athleticism.
