@Teresa_Giudice @RobynJLevy https://t.co/ZL6nWZZez5Sonja Morgan and Kristen Doute should hold a seminar on party crashing. #RHONYYo man, John is still around. WOW.
#JohhnyCleaners @Bravotv @BravoWWHL #RHONYNow more than ever our representatives in Congress must be held accountable for their decisions, healthcare literally being life and death.If that's Dorinda sober, I shudder to think how she fights when she's intoxicated. #RHONYquote of the night: "Just because you're obnoxious doesn't mean you're right." @eileen_davidson #RHOBHReunionAndy is really stirring the shit at these reunions! 😂 #RHOBHDorit danced around / insinuated that Rinna had a problem with pills multiple times without coming out and saying it directly #RHOBHReunionSheree is the MIHW this season.
Most Improved House Wife💎👑💎👑
Funny,Real &amp; Vulnerable all season!
#RHOA @Bravotv @Andy @IamShereebest question of the night... https://t.co/WFQffOkvPGI like Monique a lot!

Totally love you!! #jerseygirls 😘😘😘Just watched Real Housewives of Potomac. I ❤❤❤ @iammrssamuels I also just heard she's a Jersey girl, maybe that's why. Follow her on Twitter@LaraSophia @AllAboutTRH @FerliseNavidad hey @TheEllenShow I know you like to be told about amazing sources - this podcast is amazing! https://t.co/RomWvJ9J2C check it out!@FerliseNavidad and I are recording podcast #2 for @AllAboutTRH - tweet us any #realhousewives questions you have #RHONJ #RHOBH #RHOA #RHONYI think rumors that this season of #RHONY was bad are way off - so far I'm loving the drama and bitchiness!Carole is going to ruin #RHONY season with the election storyline. She's not involved in anyway. #EnoughAlreadylet's be honest #guiltyascharged #RHONY #SATC https://t.co/RnTci0oB7oI need to write a blog post.

It's @LaraSophia - @FerliseNavidad and I have two HUGE surprises for you - should we reveal them tonight? https://t.co/f7iYfWyGtm"A successful woman is one who can build a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at her." #RHOA #ChateauSheree https://t.co/WmjHeiaYuSWelcome to Potomac @iammrssamuels! #Jerseygirl in the house! Everyone loves a jersey girl 😉 #RHOP@Team_Giudice @FerliseNavidad @doritkemsley1 @Andy He gives me the Heebee Jeebees. Agh.@SoChill_Linda @FerliseNavidad @doritkemsley1 @Andy Because he has allowed Chris Laurita to be one. So I guess it's ok!Dorit and PK act like they are perfect but I have a feeling the reason why they got a spot is connection to Boy George.Or it was a way to tie in Boy George and Kyle Richards Celebrity Apprentic appearances. Dorit to me is a fake!Agreed. None of the other men with jobs have time to be in Housewife fights lol https://t.co/W8KAyoDPCg@FerliseNavidad @doritkemsley1 @Andy Yes @Andy why? Is PK a housewife?So you accuse someone of being cold and not nice, but it's ok for your American born wife to fake an accent! #LogicByRichPeople!Dorit trying to shade Erika's hair is comical since she's wearing Reynolds wrap on her head. #RHOBHNo one ganged up on Dorit. In my opinion, I think Erika was honest with her. #RHOBH #RHOBHFinaleSo PK steps into the  situation he is guilty of popping a peak of a lady private part, that is disgusting and gross #RHOBH #RHOBHFinalePK stop with the condesending tone you are speaking. This is wrong. You are wrong because you coped a peak. Disgusting! #RHOBHPK is that little annoying shit we all know all grown up #RHOBHAnd if Erika is cold it's because Dorit is a doo do bird who shouldn't have discussed #PantyGate as often as she did. #RHOBH #RHOBHFinaleErika really held her own. PK should put some gold foil on his new vagina. #RHOBHI find it really hard to stay mad at Rinna. She really knows how to make you okay with what she says lol #RHOBHPK is so gross. Like, BEYOND. #RHOBHVery over PK and Dorit. #RHOBHPK waiting in the shadows planning his attack is the most terrifying thing I've seen this week #RHOBH5 minutes into #RHOP and they note three people got new houses. #secondseason #ofcourseSummer bodies are overrated. Live a little. Eat the guacamole. #PumpRulesEveryone was dressed for the junior prom. #PumpRulesLupus causes the immune system to be unable to differentiate antigens and healthy tissue.The course of systemic #lupus erythematosus is unpredictable, with periods of illness (called flares) alternating with remissions.Hey Wonky, copying an Instagram, Snapchat or Tweet is not an Exclusive. https://t.co/KZp24KpbqXHi loves it's @FerliseNavidad and we've got a double dose of #ShadySunday tonight,who's joining me to #LiveTweet #RHOA &amp; #RHOP tonight @8PM?Guys, let's figure out this @blindgossipcom item. https://t.co/ZFUIkknAmp@erikajayne and I live parallel lives.
