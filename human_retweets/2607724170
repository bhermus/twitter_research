Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made todayâ€™s marches happen. Keep at it. Youâ€™re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.@WalshFreedom But Joe.
What if these students and all the people marching across the country today are actually God's answer to all those thoughts and prayers you offered to victims of gun violence? Will you ignore God when it's He who sent them?So Stormy says she and Trump had sex only once.  I guess if you want the guy to screw you repeatedly, you have to be one of his voters.Fuck you, Steve Scalise, you gun-loving human garbage. #SOTUIn #SOTU, Trump said "since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs." Jobs increased by 1.84 million under Trump - 12% lower than the 2 million jobs that were created in the 11 months before he entered office. https://t.co/KVJ2OOV27gRegrettably, Auntie must make the following prediction: Andrew McCabe will be replaced by either Rudy Giuliani or Chris Christie (I certainly hope this is not true)When Blabbermouth Don talks about who has the bigger nuclear button, I think we all know what he's talking about. It's your basic dick-measuring contest. Sad!FuxBoiDonald hates this country, you hate this country right animal @realDonaldTrump ?

Yet the @HouseGOP just voted to do exactly that #StopCCRTrump tree lighting ceremony vs Obama 2016 tree lighting ceremony.

Wait, @seanhannity didn't Obama outlaw Christmas or something? Why is his crowd so much bigly..er? https://t.co/rusLSgXmUDThis is Bahtiyar Duysak.

Duysak is the former Twitter employee, who on my birthday, November 2nd, deleted Trump's Twitter account.  

Unfortunately the backup was restored within 11 minutes.

This man deserves a RETWEET!! https://t.co/fxpUli40zFDonald Trump and Roy Moore are both serial sexual predators.

Over TWO DOZEN women have come forward, on the record, with stories about their abuse.

Trump endorsed Moore because they are the same.Wait a minute, wait a minute--did Trump just basically endorse an alleged child molester because he's a conservative and will vote for his tax bill?@Shirking_Violet @ananavarro And they donâ€™t really care about children, just embryos.Every day it becomes clearer and clearer. The reason @realDonaldTrump labeled legit news #FakeNews early on was because he knew one day all of his deceit, cheating, and harassment, would come under scrutiny by them. The truth has always been his enemy and he knew it.@GOP I ask AGAIN!! show us the detailed math.including how we can't deduct medical expenses, student loans,state and local tax deductions etc ðŸ–•Do you have a plan if Donald Trump suspends the rule of law by firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller? You should: https://t.co/3lbzcAGPXZBlaming Schumer for this is cowardly, stupid, and duplicitous. Youâ€™re a disgrace not just to America but to humanity. https://t.co/lbwxovVJxsDear friends ã€‹LET'S RISE UP &amp; RESIST! âœŠâœŠâœŠ
