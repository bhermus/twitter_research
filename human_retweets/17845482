Josh Allen, #Bills - Thumbs down. BUF moved up for a big, physical, rocket-armed QB. But his pocket presence isn‚Äôt good, &amp; although they were overblown during the pre-draft process, Allen has accuracy concerns. Those will be hard to correct.

The incels make up one segment of the broader "manosphere", a collection of online masculinist communities that interplay with one another.Josh Rosen: I would love to be in Buffalo.
