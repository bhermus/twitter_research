Jagir was killed in 1990 by Pak-sponsored terrorists. Today, a few goons are raising the national flag in support of those who (allegedly) raped and killed a child. If Jagir were alive today, he'd think hard about his decision taken more than 50 years ago.4. The transistor was gifted to him on the day he received his award along with the likes of the scientist Satish Dhawan and the artist MF Husain. Later, a junior administrative officer was sent to his village who convinced the woman’s father to get his daughter married to Jagir.3. The Centre announced a Padma Shri for Jagir. Indira Gandhi is believed to have personally asked him if she could do something for him. Jagir asked for two things: a Philips transistor and intervention with the father of a woman he wanted to marry but had been turned down.2. But instead, Jagir returned and informed the Police. His info turned out to be crucial. The armed men were Pakistanis, who had infiltrated to launch Op. Gibraltar, a secret Pakistani mission to annex Kashmir. Thanks to Jagir, the mission ended up in failure.1. #Asifa is a Gujjar-Bakerwal, a nomadic community, largely pro-India, anti-militancy. In 1965, a G-B man, Mohd. Din Jagir, spotted a few armed men in Tangmarg, Kashmir. They asked him to arrange Kashmiri clothing for them so that they could sneak in without arousing suspicionNow to suppress #UnnaoCase , expect ENCOUNTERS now.

#RajkamalBooks #HindiBooks https://t.co/CFR4vlpIK5#IranProtests: Amazing sight of huge crowd in Qom chanting "We do not want an Islamic Republic!" https://t.co/TOhBlaLOitEvery single discussion, every single tweet, every debate is viewed through the prism of politics. You are either this side or that side. This Wall of Berlin must be brought down and sanity restored. Some of us support issues of national importance, not parties. Please get that!Farmaan say pairron pay kabhi phal nahin lagtay/ talvaar say mausam koi badla nahin jaata #MuzaffarWarsi #SaturdaySherProtestors in Iran: "We are Aryans! We don't worship the Arab [God]"
This is not the first time people have used this anti-Islam slogan. The Islamist regime has given birth to strong anti-Islam sentiments in Iran. https://t.co/JAbeEalKnC"The most impactful thing of having sufficient wealth is the freedom. Freedom to be utterly, unapologetically oneself. To say things others think, but can’t say. And support things that are important"It is disgusting to see Palestinian Envoy in Pakistan sharing platform with Hafiz Saeed. Palestinian struggle was a secular one for homeland which later degenerated into a sectarian Islamist issue. Even scholars like Edward Said fought for it.आज मेरे प्रिय तेज़ाबी शायर दुष्यंत कुमार की पुण्यतिथि है। वो यही तारीख थी जब स्वभाव से दिगंत और भाव से ज्वलंत दुष्यंत अपने सीने की आग इस दुनिया को सौंप कर उस लोक की ओर मुड़ गए। आज का दिन दुष्यंत को समर्पित। 🙏❤️ https://t.co/1WsLOsFTsMमस्लहत आमेज़ होते हैं सियासत के क़दम,
तू न समझेगा सियासत, तू अभी इंसान है 

-दुष्यंत कुमार  #DushyantKumarमैं फिर जनम लूँगा
फिर मैं 
इसी जगह आऊँगा
उचटती निगाहों की भीड़ में 
अभावों के बीच

 https://t.co/Byhzz7LI9eNo intention to belittle the suffering of the Palestinians; But how can they expect support from India, when they support terrorists in Pakistan? India's national interest must come first. Israel supports India more often than not. What does Palestine do for us? https://t.co/kNGnrBWi0bUnder IWT, India kept just 19.48% of Indus waters for itself. But India isn't utilizing even its share, with Pakistan getting over a quarter of India's share as bonus waters. Note: For this modest project, only "a detailed project report" so far finalized: https://t.co/VDrOXYDwGEEasy. Patriotism is based on love, nationalism on hate. https://t.co/5H2Q0Adh7l5 IAS officers who made a mark in North East India. #Rolemodels

मैं उठता था मुँह धो के”

https://t.co/NOCNDvLve4Universal human rights, constitutional freedoms, gender equality &amp; end to inequality by birth - these must always have precedence over caste, race, religion &amp; tradition. Let us hope our children will inherit a world of equal opportunity and reciprocity. https://t.co/QhOKaLzJ4jGender is nt something to b proud of,nor it is somthng to b ashamed of. Ppl like Musharaf who try to use it fr thr advantage n to ridicule othrs must b ashamed of thr behaviour. 
Pakistan is thankful to great women like Fatima Jinnah,Benazir,Malala etc.
