I am truly amazed by what hapens when men call out other men. Society listens to men, not women. Hannibal Buress calling out Bill Cosby, and Vince Staples calling out R. Kelly was more impactful than thousands of women‚Äôs voices. Now, imagine if our MCMs called out their friends. https://t.co/Td2OeOpp7aShow your allyship and ‚Äúmale feminism‚Äù by calling out your friends who rape and abuse women, young king.john legend doing the yeoman's work of teaching ap us history to a 40 year old https://t.co/j87vu9gw3Kearth &amp; water signs when they are forced to leave their house https://t.co/mOwUqzwkcXWhen there‚Äôs a dog https://t.co/e3RraMbtrfSomeone‚Äôs angelic today... https://t.co/44bTDEZlt5i get high on:

- You can be racist without intent
- You can be racist w/out being malicious 

There are so many ways you can be racist and u just have to learn from it but what we're NOT gonna do is get defensive and start trying to defend ourselves with excusesThis is Kylo. He just had his very first checkpup. Good boy levels off the h*ckin charts. 13/10 would noggin pat https://t.co/rjdQ691x1eThe entire morning shift at my regular @Starbucks was staffed by people of color today. Boycott them if you must but please know: the real problem isn‚Äôt a coffee company. The real problem is white people calling the police on us for existing. https://t.co/3zp0P3i7HCThis is Wilson.

Nobody was handing out verified Twitter accounts &amp; Time covers to Black youth organizers when Freddie Grey was killed.Here is a very supportive pup toting a simple statement while marching with her humans today. 14/10 #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/BID54BRiCwWe‚Äôve got fanny packs! üòé RT this photo to win a free one. https://t.co/zQmZ9egwjUNever forget when Black youth protested in Ferguson they called the national guard.1. They handcuffed Stephon Clark's lifeless body after shooting him 20x. 
2. Dylann Roof was calmly taken into custody after massacring 9 people - and then taken to get Burger King because he was hungry.

The patriarchy isn't men. It's a system that prefers them. Wanting to dismantle the patriarchy isn't man hate. It's a solution to injustice, and it will benefit us all. Ditto to ending white supremacy.This is the only criticism of millenials I will accept https://t.co/M5hgfzTDidUnpaid internships favor students who come from privilege, whose parents can pay their way while they gain experience to become more competitive applicants for schools/jobs. They reinforce systems of oppression and continue to stratify society based on socioeconomic hierarchies. https://t.co/aYcI2PU7L0ok can we stop using 'femmes' as a stand in for when you mean 'women' or 'women and nonbinary people' or 'women and women-aligned nonbinary people' or 'people who are perceived as feminine' or 'people who participate in traditionally feminine presentation' bc thems diff conceptsI googled Obama doing cute shit.  I was not disappointed. https://t.co/r8lfI7adtpA fun reminder that MEN ARE TRASH on international women‚Äôs day!!!@ktkittelson Not like it‚Äôs the first time...Scorpio: I hate poetry
Me: I'm not much of a poetry person myself
Scorpio: You hate poetry?
Me: Don't you?
Scorpio: No, that was just one of my truth extraction methods.https://t.co/AVDn3rm18OChildren who are taught from an early age that you can love whoever you want regardless of gender will not be confused. Confusion comes when you push the idea that there is only ONE way to love.The amount of backlash I received when i created #GiveElsaAGirlfriend was tremendous. The same people who say they "aren't homophobic" and "accept gay people" are the same ones who don't want their "children exposed" to this... I wonder why exactly you don't?People don't seem to realize that their perceptions/mentality is socially conditioned. YOU think a kids movie depicting an LGBT relationship would be confusing because you didn't grow up around LGBT relationships. Kids raised in an LGBT friendly environment would not be confused.You will never end abortion. You will only end safe abortions. https://t.co/nJgWPt3lYr
