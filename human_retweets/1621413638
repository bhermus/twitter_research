Your comfort zone will kill youI would like a boring life. Not forever. Just for a bit. Just a nice, quiet, boring life where nothing happens. That's all.It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend and #Gogglebox legend Leon. We will all miss him so very dearly. Our thoughts are with June and family at this incredibly sad time. 💔👸🏼💃🏼💫📸💁🏼✌🏽🍃🎉🌍✨ https://t.co/Ev4GrpucmTUnfortunately today was not the day for our story to be heard. Due to breaking news our story was cut off live tv. The royal wedding will go ahead however mental health issues will always remain ❤️ until next time Dad. #breakthestigma https://t.co/jbjcDeNvklAbsolutely bonkers that we are even in a situation that requires this to be posted. #Repost @animalheroawards (@get_repost)
