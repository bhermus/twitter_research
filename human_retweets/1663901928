Moral of the story? Corporate America doesn’t care about you, so steal steal steal while you’re still young“Our histories tend to discuss American slavery so impartially, that in the end nobody seems to have done wrong and everybody was right. Slavery appears to have been thrust upon unwilling helpless America, while the South was blameless in becoming its center.”

3. then give guns to guns (it's in the constitution)
4. then give guns to the guns who just got guns
5. then give additional guns to teachers
