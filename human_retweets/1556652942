This coal-free stretch is likely to end some time tomorrow evening, after a continuous 64+ hours. https://t.co/DEmU2stlDKThis seems like a sounder plan than a tarsands pipeline #StopKM https://t.co/jAEazXozN3Today, the city of Boulder, Colorado filed a lawsuit against two of the largest fossil fuel companies in the world over their role in perpetuating climate change. https://t.co/OxYN6fzszDEducation is our investment in the future.

1. Trump is treating Pompeo as Secretary of State, even though he hasn't been confirmed by the Senate.
2. Trump has broken the long-standing US policy of our officials NOT meeting with Kim Jong Un with no conditions.

https://t.co/xLhuFKSr2hFour baboons planned their escape from your facility and escaped by positioning a 55 pound barrel so they could climb out. What does that tell you about your facility? You make me sick @txbiomed - have the decency to send them to a sanctuary. https://t.co/jRhD9xjG2LThis makes me so angry! Have the decency to send these baboons to a sanctuary @txbiomed. They collaborated to plan their escape - doesn‚Äôt they tell you something? Have some mercy @txbiomed https://t.co/dV2SvJeVw8This is heartbreaking. 4 baboons worked together to roll a 55 gallon barrel and escape the research facility where they were subject to horrifying medical experiments.

We didn‚Äôt want a bunch of angry old white men to decide our future and our president, but here we are.@CharlesMBlow Barack Obama went to the same church for over a decade but he wasn‚Äôt Christian enough for white evangelicals. Trump cheats on his wife, multiple divorces and can‚Äôt pronounce Corinthians correctly. Now tell me again on how this is NOT about race.I'm no longer sure what country I'm living in. America seems to be putrefacting into a new Russian republic, aided and abetted by the premeditated collusion of a president* and Party who have placed power above principle and money before morals. #TheResistance #FBR @docrocktex26 https://t.co/U6wy8xoK6ELoyalty is VERY important to Trump ‚Äî and he demonstrated his loyalty to Putin yesterday by overruling the new Russian scanctions. #TrumpRussiaTrump ordered an investigation of "welfare" programs, searching for "wasteful spending." Here's an idea, @realDonaldTrump. Let‚Äôs do a thorough investigation of your admin, starting with @ScottPruittOK and @SecretaryCarson.

The hypocrisy of Trump and the @GOP knows no bounds.On a real news network, Hannity would be fired for giving endless commentary defending Michael Cohen while secretly being a client of his. 

Lucky for Sean he doesn‚Äôt work for a real news network.Why is there so much corruption in the @realDonaldTrump Administration? https://t.co/byencWnipOWE WONT LET HIM QUIETLY TARGET MEDICAID AND FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS, WILL WE? https://t.co/ime9J2CLetMichael Avenatti's prediction on Michael Cohen flipping on the president. https://t.co/ZSVijgLLDNSean Hannity should be fired. 

He repeatedly did segments praising and defending Michael Cohen without ever disclosing that Cohen was his lawyer. 

It‚Äôs unethical, even for FOX News.

#FireHannity#BlueWave in 2018 means we need to try to repair (more $) the middle class tax cuts the @gop screwed up and repeal the rich cuts entirely, it is NOT going to be easy in 2019 + but if we dont this, it will cause a financial bomb to go off in a few years.Comey: Americans are "duty bound" to vote Trump out  https://t.co/PMsbjiCZ63 https://t.co/rU49zkZxkdEx-Dem lawmaker: I wasn‚Äôt planning to read Comey book until I saw Trump‚Äôs "pants-wetting Twitter meltdown" https://t.co/GC4xJEfwVS https://t.co/TEkUSL0Q0cJames Comey says President Trump is a serial liar, treats women like ‚Äúmeat‚Äù and is a ‚Äústain‚Äù on all who work for him.

Despite your best efforts
I‚Äôm still not scared of immigrants

I choose inclusion

And I think most others do too.112 tomahawk missiles were launched at Syria...

- That costed $224,000,000

- 11% of Puerto Rico is w/out power 

- Flint still has lead in it‚Äôs water

- There are 40,000 homeless vets

- 15% of our country is in poverty 

Talk about priorities, right?The War Powers Act of 1973 is clear. Without an attack on the US or its forces, the president must seek Congressional authorization to attack. Obama sought authorization on Syria (Trump sarcastically tweeted he had to as well). Congress refused
