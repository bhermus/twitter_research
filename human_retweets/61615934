Black women, take care of your health. Don‚Äôt put off your checkups. Don‚Äôt hesitate when something feels off. Listen to your bodies &amp;
trust your intuition. Please.I use this one all the time: ‚ÄúBig numbers always look big. Small numbers on their own are misleading‚Ä¶ Always look for comparisons.‚Äù https://t.co/nl9VK3t2iPHappy Easter everyone. May you find renewal in faith, health, love and #APPyness. https://t.co/NKJbSjbpQ0The players are really forcing the hand of Stan.

We‚Äôre now at the point where there‚Äôs a decision to be made on Wenger now. Stop the rot. Start the rebirth early.These Arsenal players are trying to get Wenger sacked... No other explanation..

It's understandable.
If I had the chance to play for The Arsenal but had to settle for playing for Spurs, I'd be bitter too.....Who is the better signing?

Arsenal - 245
Man U - 248
Chelsea - 251
Man City - 699
Liverpool - 2,162
Spurs - 3,625In all honesty, the contract side of the club is a mess.
You can't make players put pen to paper, but you have to have some contingency plan for when they don't!
I just feel there's big problems behind the scenes at Arsenal, &amp; Wenger will tell all one day...
#AFCUntil Jesus is enough for you, no person or thing will ever be.Like I said last week, Man Utd are in the same situation as Arsenal, a team who are miles away from being title contenders, at least we have accepted our fate until Wenger goes, Utd fans need to wake up, you have spent over ¬£500m to be nothing more than a side fighting for top 4I am thankful for the male friends who didn't scurry away into dark corners on realizing that I had no sexual feelings for them. Some definitely did and it hurt, but their loss really.
