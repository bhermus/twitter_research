Who knew we had to lose Kanye to gain Donald Glover but here we are.Men of kidlit ask me how they can help. A big way would be to speak up when stuff like this happens. https://t.co/OSOYkhS5IxA very good evening to everyone, but especially Donald Glover.This is so disheartening &amp; enraging, another example of how white male “genius” has long gotten creeps and abusers off the hook (see also Allen, Polanski, et al.) Their legacies will and should suffer, &amp; they brought it upon themselves. Lit world, stop aiding &amp; abetting. https://t.co/0jUNs4yovnOne of the most beautiful, painful, honest pieces of art I’ve seen in my entire life.

https://t.co/uEapN4E6ItDonald Glover is a good example of just embracing all the shit that makes you weird and making it work for you. #SNLIn one night Donald Glover 
+ Hosts SNL (a very black episode of SNL)
+ Performs New Song on SNL
+ Debuts another new song on YouTube (at the same time)
+ appears in commercial break for new Star Wars movie
+ Performs the 2nd new song in a hologram or somethingThe biggest advice I give young women is to build a home on chicken feet, stake out a yard with the skulls of the unworthy, grow herbs, make soup, bake bread, keep an owl and a cat for company, use a walking stick, raise lost girls, and keep a good accountant on the side. https://t.co/HWIVqyNvFiOr you could end poverty.

But Kanye is normalizing a man that is specifically &amp; quantifiably problematic. 

It matters.Milo getting yelled out of a bar is exactly how we should treat people with abhorrent ideologies. They are not entitled to civility or a debate; they should absolutely be pushed to the margins.Woo!

The teachers say: we don't want guns.

We really really don't.

Not even a little.

What we do want — what we need, even — is books.

Many, many books.

Cheaper than guns, and they give life instead of death.

Win-win.

There are over 3 million public school teachers in this country.
That's a lot of gun sales.
If the NRA can't make money off school shootings, goes the NRA's thinking, what's the point?We talk a lot about who the NRA funds but not enough about who funds the NRA. They are a lobbying group for gun manufacturers and therefore push for positions that lead to more guns being bought in this country.Parents, what would you do if your child and fellow students were brutally murdered on school property? https://t.co/9XAOlwOmLvVery proud that Downingtown just passed a resolution to call on legislators to ban assault weapons, require background checks on all gun sales, and to reduce the number of permissible cartridges in a clip or magazine.How quaint that some folks are more concerned about kids speaking respectfully than the fact that 17 kids were slaughtered with an assault rifle.
