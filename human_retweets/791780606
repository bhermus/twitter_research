DO NOT judge
DO NOT whisper to your friends about them

be kind always

It’s May 2012

You’re in Year 9 English and the bell rings

The room fills with Lynx Africa and that pink Hollister spray

Everyone’s buzzing to go sit on the field and eat their cheese and tomato pasta pot in the sun 

Life is good.Five whole ass years in jail for VOTING. Brock Turner got 3 months for brutally raping a girl, cops get paid vacations for shooting people... I don’t know what further proof you need to understand our justice system is built on white supremacy and works against people of color. https://t.co/Rii5wMOUbB
