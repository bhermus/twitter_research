Runs onto the floor to celebrate because he thinks it's a timeout, then has to be pulled off the floor 😂 https://t.co/5tw8LD7zWR😤 https://t.co/Ruzxze1qHWThe NBA acknowledged Thursday that LeBron's block at the end of Game 5 should have resulted in a goaltending call. https://t.co/cn8ZW4ostnVictor Oladipo on LeBron's block: "It was a goaltend. I mean it's hard to even speak on it. It just sucks."
Also from Oladipo: “The series ain’t over. You’ve got to win four games for the series to be over, right?” https://t.co/nfob1U913EDidi Gregorius is the first shortstop in Yankees history to hit a home run in four straight games.

He has nine homers in April, matching Derek Jeter's career high for any single month (June 2004). https://t.co/MDOeSI6oV7Dearest mother —
It is with tremendous excitement I inform you I drilled with the unit today. Although not in full uniform, I donned my hat and supply pack. No rounds from my sidearm were discharged, but other maneuvers were carried out successfully. My resolve grows.

ICE IN HIS VEINS. @MickstapeShow https://t.co/W47AkQ65G4Moral victories don't exist, especially in the playoffs, but confidence does and consider: Cavs led 22-4, James scored 46, Pacers outscored by 15 from 3 on the road in a playoff game the Cavs had to have - and IND lost by 3. Lots to like as the Pacers head home.After 21 consecutive wins in the first round, LeBron and his Cavs take heavy a Game 1 L to the Indiana team we all keep sleeping onThis man went into Cleveland and put on a clinic. https://t.co/dK4j3BtaZjCold-blooded? https://t.co/I4VgGflzBYNot getting enough sleep and being hungry are the two biggest reasons for being angryWhose city is it? https://t.co/OI2uPP1WcKBiggest K.

Joyous news! The unit’s trusted sniper, Sgt. Vinatieri, shall return for one more campaign. Soldiers of his talent are cut from a small, much desired cloth. Fortune smiles upon us. We will need his skill in the most dire of situations.

You didn’t grow super powers.It’s sad that people think a guy catching the ball at the six yard line and having it hit the ground after diving one yard into the end zone, a distance of 21 FEET does not involve a football move. And embarrassing quite frankly. https://t.co/ETcxPfuWQsPhiladelphia has officially gone full Cleveland by eating horse shit, never go full Cleveland https://t.co/RoMUkjGfrhHOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE

#Bengals50Camels gave humans the common cold.OLADIP-OH MY... https://t.co/jfFFUdHpnhSaying “I’m a man,” and “I’m not going to let someone disrespect me” is the most childish and overplayed cliche in our society. What being a man really means is having the DISCIPLINE to look someone in the eye, control your emotions, and walk away. https://t.co/S4qC1CcRfxVictor Oladipo’s nickname should be “Rated R”, because he’s showing more adult stuff than PG 13.Since @IUMensSoccer became a varsity sport in 1973, it will have now played in exactly 1/3 of all NCAA championship games (15).
