1/ Brexit and the great free trade agreement farceTomorrow is the deadline to register to vote in #8thRef. 

Here's the form. Print this and bring it to your local council office. There are no second chances from here on out. 

https://t.co/lwC8McF34YThe alt-right's bullshit about "white genocide" is not a new idea at all. In the early 20th century, it was called "race suicide". 

The anti-immigrant arguments from 1917 sound exactly like the ones being made today.

The Border is not being used as an excuse to achieve something else, it is an issue -- and for IRL it is the issue -- in its own right. That is a difficult concept for a certain type of British elite to grasp. https://t.co/IocoZZU5J4"I am voting yes" https://t.co/Hdnpde0yLVNah, British Empire pre-dates Marx by a few centuries https://t.co/ORdalphEJ5Nothing has persuaded EU citizens of the value of the EU like Brexit. Support up in 28 states. https://t.co/ZfwXOcipg1An open letter calling for a Yes vote on May 25. 

We are all #together4yes

Vote Yes on May 25 for a more caring and compassionate Ireland. https://t.co/dSG3W1TGRC🎶"You do it to yourself, you do,

Here, I examine Mr Bassett’s claims and respond to them. https://t.co/ayW0brotQS"Have some empathy, trust our women, give them the choice, You don’t know the day it will be your sister, your daughter, your wife."

The correct phrase is the Irish's weaponisation of the EU. 
And what a weapon it is. https://t.co/rLqhevCk73Here are new jobs now on Connect:

#ECForecastProblem here is that these guys are only now experiencing the power of the EU as an external entity as opposed to a member. They seem genuinely surprised how powerful it is. This is why we are staying in. https://t.co/qgAZczhex2It’s not fear of “abortion” that has certain Pro Life groups so hysterical..
It’s the fear of losing all that lovely American money that has propped them up for years. They lost on divorce and SSM marriage, this is their last BIG meal ticket and they’ll lie to keep it.
💰 💵💵💰It’s 2299. The 280th year of the Brexit transition period. The cabinet meets for the 389,575th time to agree a solution for the Irish border but the technology still doesn’t exist. They agree to go away &amp; think again. The cryogenically preserved head of Jacob Rees Mogg is livid. https://t.co/vhHzshVE6NMy new favorite game on Twitter:

Russian bot or idiot?These people ARE Irish. It's a bit disingenuous of McGuirk to pretend he is not aware of who these people are. Dr Kirsten Fuller campaigns on Save The 8th's stalls in Tipp &amp; is registered as a GP at the same Fethard clinic as Dr Engela. ICBR is basically Provisional Save The 8th. https://t.co/HRMdIbjGyQIt is with great sadness that I announce the sudden death of irony in the Seanad at approx 3:50pm on Tuesday afternoon.

Ronan Mullen was complaining about women's healthcare needs being exported to another country.

My thoughts are with irony's family at this difficult time. https://t.co/Cu3xO973HkFrom @PwC_UK today:

"The UK has been the slowest growing economy relative to the US and the Eurozone for the fourth consecutive quarter - something last experienced 12 years ago."

Thanks #BrexitShambles https://t.co/NEPcHqcw8CHouse of Lords just voted by large majority (67) to require any Brexit deal to honour the Good Friday Agreement. Vital for peace &amp; prosperity of Northern Ireland - &amp; IrelandOoh

Tolkien correcting exam papers here like he did in the 1940s and 1950s #exams #Tolkien #NUIGalway https://t.co/I2c3bUXXPvBeing pregnant in Ireland is legit scary when you have a good understanding of how the 8th impacts on your "care". https://t.co/vLdt2GerN6For those trying to conflate the #cervicalcheck scandal with the #Savita case, there is no constitutional amendment preventing the reading of smear tests. Hope that's cleared matters up for you. #Together4YesOh good. Because what I definitely, definitely need in my life is a chance to swipe left on my own cousin. https://t.co/iyNsIISTexThere is a live experiment going on right now on how Facebook's words match up to the reality of its actions...in Ireland. And it's not looking pretty. https://t.co/xyIUP89yZpPhoto of the year by National Geographic's Bob Burton. Amazing https://t.co/K7eXy7UmQR"The truth about migration" Brilliant and important article in @newscientist https://t.co/tFtwZZ2QHT Why are politicians not telling is the truth? @debmackenzie1 https://t.co/yYBnRRXvd6EU comms vs UK comms. https://t.co/hTHVRajhe4#repealfacts Safe abortion IS healthcare- according to: 1) the World Health Organisation 2) the Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists and  3) the International Federation  of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Just #repealthe8th #togetherforyesGreat to see #YouthForYes trending number one on Twitter! #Together4Yes https://t.co/AJQXpD1yzkMy response to this weekend's letter in the Irish Times about @repeal_shield. Published today. #RepealThe8th #8thRef https://t.co/zFGxVZ0NY0If the so-called Left thinks that the flawed policies that led to the Greek tragedy can be challenged  by breaking up European Left alliances -‘socialism in one country’ - they are deluded. https://t.co/deYhbv3grkWoman: "Omg, I can't be pregnant! I have an underlying health condition &amp; pregnancy could kill me!"
Man: "Don't worry, I'll take you to a Doctor!"
Woman: "Doctor? Are you mad? Sure it's a Bishop, a politician, a businessman, a lawyer &amp; a religious DJ I need!"
Said no woman ever.What's the only thing dumber than tariffs?

Quotas.

They're just like tariffs—both reduce the quantity of imports—but quotas have the added feature of *not* raising revenue. https://t.co/xP6BChVg1mAbortion that is free, safe, legal &amp; accessible is essential to meet our Sustainable Development Goals. Somewhere in the world 70 women &amp; girls will die in the next 24 hours because of unsafe abortion. Difference= Ireland is close to the UK &amp; rich. #RepealThe8th #togetherforyes https://t.co/LnNQ24a1e8You know it's exam time by the intensity of the blue in the sky.
