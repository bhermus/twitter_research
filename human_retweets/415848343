Ppl wanted tickets to my graduation but wasn’t there to support me. Nobody checked on me or asked if I needed anything but wanted to attend. Moral: no one ever wants to be w/ you on your journey but loves to shine w/ you @ the destination.You ever look at someone’s tweet and think stfuif somebody genuinely loves u , like truly loves u, they’re not going to care about your body or how you look. I’m so tired of lil comments like “ nah bro she got a little booty” and “ nah she ain’t even that thick” like wtf? Mijo, las apariencias se acaba, la personalidad no.¡Gracias por bailar con nosotros! 🌴🎶
