Kung nararamdaman mong nakikibasa ng text yung katabi mo, bigla mong i-type: "ano salvage ko na ba 'tong katabi ko?" GANOIN!!!Yung mga  taong post ng post sa facebook na kala mo interesting pag na-click mo umuungol. Mga leche kayo!! Tigil nyo yan, di nakakaganda 🙄Malandi lang 'yan. Wag kang mafa-fall. Masasaktan ka langKung hindi pa nagselfie sa fitting room 'di pa magkakaroon ng bagong damit 🙄Palayain ang isa't isa! Kung tayo, tayo talaga! 🙊😂 Happy Independence Day! HAHA :))) ❤️“I don’t think it’s pathetic to cry over someone. It just means you care about them deeply and you’re sad.”“Only a few people care. The rest are just curious”Waiting for my forever be like: https://t.co/QrIpfni3ghI change, I grow up, I fall in love, I get hurt. That's normal. I'm just a teenager. Still learning.May mga tao talaga na kahit ibigay mo pa ang lahat sa kanila, naghahanap pa rin ng iba.Life is too short to wake up with regrets.Sometimes, I just want to sleep so I can escape reality for a while.All I need is someone who is ready to accept my flaws.Someday, I’ll be someone’s first priority.Unfortunately I'm the type of person that you can screw over 1 million times and I would still be there for you if you needed me.People who are too happy don’t see the warning signs of dangerous people or situations and are more willing to trust when they shouldn't.People who laugh more are able to tolerate pain better, both physical and emotional.Having someone ask you " are you okay?" actually causes you to tear up even more when you're trying not to cry.
