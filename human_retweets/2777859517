No, let me correct that, I miss the old you. I miss the old you that cared about me and liked to cuddle.You are too blessed to be stressed. Stop focusing on the negatives. Only embrace the positives.I'm not over you because I don't like you anymore, I'm over you because I've realized that you're never going to want me like I want you.I try to think back to where it all went wrong, and now I remember it was when I first saw you and thought you could be the one.I hate seeing you because you bring back the feelings I try so hard to forget.I don't miss him, I miss who I thought he was.The hardest thing to accept is loving someone and knowing they'll never love you back.Sometimes the more you hide your feelings for someone, the more you fall for them.Sometimes you wait so long for something that when it finally arrives you no longer need it.Always tell people how you feel about them.
