Seeing an age appropriate Bond girl was awesome..even though this movie sucked. Daniel defending Monica to the press questioning her age was epic. Done w/ageism against women. We dont expire at 40. Quit telling women our beauty is only best from 18-39 https://t.co/srfYFpOLsFI think sharing those experiences make my videos much better and more honest. And I gravitate towards other videos that have similar candor.A comment: "Your videos would be better if you stopped talking about your mental illness. This is about games." 

That's where you're wrong. I do have some gaming channel, but it's about the role gaming has played in my life, and how I've managed hardship.zelda majoras mask n64
