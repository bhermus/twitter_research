üé•: Afreefilms https://t.co/X942C32iaEmusic is incredible. the act of throwing reality out the window and getting fucking lost. the world is fucked, but for those 3-4 minutes everything is okay.Illeniums entire career is remixing songs and completely shitting on the original. If you let illenium remix your song you are agreeing to have at max the 2nd best version of that song.when life knocks you down but you smile through the pain https://t.co/BQqRG3W4bTNever ask men for help with your homework https://t.co/y6IVq77OHUü§§ https://t.co/zlDAg4UW3RMAJOR FUCKING CHAMPION üèÜ üá∫üá∏WHAT A GAME.

Preset sounds are great but the fabric of what makes songs special and authentic is in the human touch. Learning to design/record sound is an imperative part of discovering your own musical identity &amp; connecting deeply to your own art. https://t.co/bMLfISjQz7I like to stay up at night because the world feels like it stops for a few hours and you don‚Äôt have any responsibilitiesomg im playing #bonnaroo!
