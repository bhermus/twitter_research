It is more than rules and stories. It's a love letter proving God not only loves us, but has already demonstrated His love for us on the cross. Don't let God’s love letter to you fall between the cracks. https://t.co/hikeTHCmLlYou are never so far away from God that He cannot reach you. He can answer your prayer for help before you even pray it. There is nothing He cannot do for you.RT this now to save me from elimination! luh you all.

@NBCTheVoice @nodoubt @gwenstefaniBarbara Bush was a remarkable woman. She had grit &amp; grace, brains &amp; beauty. She was fierce &amp; feisty in support of her family &amp; friends, her country &amp; her causes. She showed us what an honest, vibrant, full life looks like. Hillary and I mourn her passing and bless her memory.@CalebJohnson dam your cover of Faithfully is probably better than the original....if not better then a close 2nd. Awesome ...Cheers!Thinking about Barbara Bush’s legacy of service to our country and the extraordinary family she raised. Thanking her for her many kindnesses to me and my family. Wishing her the comfort she deserves surrounded by her loved ones.We just announced the inaugural class of #ObamaFellows. These 20 civic leaders have carried out inspiring work around the world.
