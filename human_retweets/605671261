Life is just better with God. Knowing He’s always in control. Knowing He has a plan that is good. Knowing that this life isn’t just one big coincidence and that you aren’t just here by chance, but that the creator of everything purposely made you for greatness. Don’t miss it.Your body not summer ready? No worries, summer isn’t coming this yearHE IS RISEN!

And I've never heard anything more trueOne team.
One community.
One goal.
One belief.
One family.
It starts with ONE playoff game.
And this is just the beginning.
