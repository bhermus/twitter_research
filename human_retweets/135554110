Tristan left his pregnant, Black gf for Khloe and she took him, which makes her just as trash as he was for leaving. https://t.co/UJdmrXa1uXTristan Thompson cheating on Khloe is the manifestation of how you get him is how you lose him.Im 35 years old, blood. The fewer friends i keep around the fewer excuses i need to make about not showing up to things smh. 😭Curving a person, like everything else, is not one size fits all.

But only good defenders get to pull the "where's the help" card. Melo gotta shoot straight and say some shit like "Aye cmon man y'all can't have him doing me like this"Look at this cute candle @heyassante is burning while we record 💕

(https://t.co/pNbHEERO2j) https://t.co/ZNj1rbiCrDYou don’t owe anybody a reason for not talking to them anymore. That’s just what it is.

She gave him her number for her immediate safety. He’s not entitled to shit.God is so gracious. ❤️GOAT with the go ahead bucket and then the assist to make it a 3 pt game and the trap on Steph.  Nothing but respect for my president.I can appreciate LeBron James response.  “I don’t know who she is, and I don’t know what station she works on.”  🤣🤣🤣Haters don’t get acknowledged publicly.

It goes without saying that the Department of Justice will do nothing about it.Black voters don't exist to save white voters from themselves, it is time to more actively punish our white voting family and friends who make so close a race possible.@KingJames  https://t.co/DRjSPyYFg8That whole narrative of "he didn't treat you right because you ain't the one" is lazy as hell. Some men literally can't treat you right because they ain't shit. Surprise.southerners: this snow is so pretty!
northerners: this isn't even a real snow- just you wait. i was born in an igloo and i drove to school on a snowmobile. we eat ice for every meal. i can't wait to die in a snow bank. warmth? never heard of it.A visual. https://t.co/oa2ckCv6jC@TheTownGQ  - Can't Run https://t.co/aLzHpOqsdN via @YouTubePpl that don’t actually fight in wars, really like that term “war” https://t.co/4OCbYIH3kSThis is why Trump won’t tweet about Lebron. His boycott really hurt Trump pockets. https://t.co/Szcrzq0ZRAAfter LeBron refused to stay at the Trump Soho, a staff member told @SarahMaslinNir, regular business from sports teams dried up. Soon, it won’t be the Trump Soho. That’s the real reason Trump hasn’t attacked LeBron. He has an acute affect on his brand. https://t.co/VKXni1WL4zForget who it was that said it, but whoever said “The Warriors didn’t need KD, they just needed KD to not be on OKC” was dead on accurate https://t.co/5Lzfd6tG3RYou deserve to be loved boldly.
