Praying common sense prevails Saturday@bornatotter It's a weird paradox as BW have a very good manager and an excellent team. However everything else about them sucks.“@TranmereRovers fans! Good luck this weekend, and if you’re one of the lucky teams to join us at Wembley do you fancy the chance to present the trophy if your team wins? Simply follows Vanarama and RT for a chance to win this amazing prize. Competition closes on 7/5/18” https://t.co/NNn4uXWwSbThe morning after, now it’s all settled down.

No, she went in her Honda Accord.Terrible news about Michael Goolaerts. All you can do is think of his family friends and team. A reminder that our sport seems like a game so much of the time, but the risks the riders run means it can also have a dark, dark side.Completely heartbroken about the passing of Michael Goolaerts. May all strength from the whole world of cycling help his @Snipercycling team-mates, friends and family get through this incredibly sad time. Rest in peace, champion. https://t.co/dzeiy6mZlcFrom last week’s Tour of Flanders. A better photo by which to remember Michael Goolaerts. https://t.co/OGSDiV4NRW👏 Nothing but respect and class 🤝
