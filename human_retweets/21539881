1) Commit crimes
2) Become cable news pundit
3) Rise to political or lobbying power

This describes not only a large number of public officials, but Trump too.

It's why cable news should stop hiring unrepentant criminals to analyze political crimes. This is where it leads. https://t.co/4RHxgFme2UMake no mistake: the loss of over 600 more bookstores would be a cataclysmic blow to literacy and reading and empathy in America.

https://t.co/XAXjWsEvq9Based on the large volume of angry tweets by @realDonaldTrump this #MondayMorning, I think there may be two possibilities. Either @POTUS didn't sleep well, or he has been informed that more bad news is going to break this week.Mueller is a Republican. Rosenstein is a Republican. The FBI Director is a Republican. @realDonaldTrump, this isn’t a witch hunt.

Stop.

She called you out for your fraudulence, and your response shouldn't be false outrage and hit pieces—but mea culpas and profuse apologies.

The three-year performance of candidate and president Donald Trump has been vulgar, unseemly, &amp; infinitely more damaging to our civic discourse.This essay by former CIA Director Michael Hayden outlines the devastating impact Trump is having on our intelligence community. Most chilling is the observation that post-truth is pre-fascism! https://t.co/0pM43zeyMdhey, remember when our feckless, craven media treated Trump like a harmless joke during the campaign and gave him hours of free air time and never once called him out on his lies or challenged him on his racist and ignorant worldview?

hey, let's all get mad at Michelle WolfLots of news nuggets in this story https://t.co/EUbyytUgpTI can’t believe Michelle Wolf called Sarah Sanders a dog...

Oh wait that was Rush Limbaugh on 12 year old Chelsea Clinton..

But Michelle did call Sarah a pig...

Oh wait that was Donald Trump on Rosie..

What did Michelle say again?

Oh yeah...exposed Sarah for the liar she is.Any journalist saying Michelle Wolf attacked Sarah Huckabee Sanders for her looks is not a very good journalist. Lordy, there are tapes! You just outed yourself as someone unable to relay basic, fresh-from-the-oven facts!So glad prominent republicans draw the line at smokey eye but not at nazi.He claims he is different from all previous presidents.

Sarah should apologize everyday for gaslighting and lying to the American public for her criminal boss!I have comedian friends who've done #WHCD. Many writer friends who've written WHCD jokes. I always advised them precisely on the line they shouldn't cross. I respected the line. They did too but still they made mistakes. 

Then Trump destroyed the line.

THERE IS NO LINE.There were two speeches last night:

Michelle Wolf - “Sarah Huckabee Sanders tells lies”

Trump- “Mexico is World War Z and I will shut the country down if Congress doesn’t pay for my wall”

Press Coverage - MICHELLE WOLF IS A MONSTERIt's not as though Wolf was expected to deliver a PowerPoint about armadillos, but unexpectedly veered into an edgy comedy routine mocking the White House. She did basically what was asked of her. Same with Colbert, Sykes &amp; Wilmore, all of whom generated similar "controversies".Yes, @michelleisawolf went to far, right? This, of course, was fine. 👇 https://t.co/JdLWFQ0bOLTotally not a horrid joke, right? (Trick question. All of Mike Huckabee's alleged zingers are horrid.) https://t.co/Bjpa9PYCJHIf you are a Trump supporter or member of his administration and aren’t willing to condemn his vulgar and mean spirited behavior every day, then i don’t want to hear what you have to say about a comedian.The president blackmailed a U.S. Senator on national television last night. But a comedian was mean to people at prom, so guess which story is leading today's news.#MichelleWolf didn't "stoop to Trump's level" at the #WHCD.
 
When she uses the power of the White House to craft legislation that cripples the poor and marginalized, and assails our environmental protections, civil rights, and Free Press—she'll be stooping to his level.

Stop.@cspanwj @HardballChris So only trump gets to be mean? Is that right, Chris? Just want to make sure I've got the new rule down.

Michelle Wolf did just that at the WHCD.

If you respect HIM for speaking his mind, you should respect HER also.“There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.”
