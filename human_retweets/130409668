Dear @SAPoliceService @SAgovnews @GovernmentZA @govchatsa @The_DSD @gauteng

Here is something to ponder on 

#RIPKatlego https://t.co/Q2hSXYDhebThis law that a person has to be missing for 24hrs before they can be reported to the police and they do something is nonsensical when it comes to kids. 

Where could a 10 year old autistic kid go to on her own for over 24hrs if she isn't lost or kidnapped?

Us men need to ask ourselves often when it comes to our partners or significant others because I'm not sure we act like it.

Do you love her?

Not because she's smoking hot, not because she gives you everything she has and everything she is.
