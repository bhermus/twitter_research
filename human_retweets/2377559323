They are one of the most abused pets in the US. they cannot live in a tiny plastic tank with a bit of water, it painfully deforms them &amp; stunts their growth. Slider turtles live 30 years or more, but most are killed too early by shitty owners like this https://t.co/qddWx7MC5aProbably the guy who led it in 2016, still nearly broke 1,000 yards after missing six games in 2017 and has a chip on his shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in 2018.
