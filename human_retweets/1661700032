#iHeartAwards #BTS #BestBoyBandJin: “I was in college at the time when the casting director saw me getting off a bus and ran after me. It was like fate. If it hadn’t been for that, there would be no worldwide handsome.” 
RM: “Well, someone else would have taken your place.” 
😂😂😂Taehyung has that unique kind of voice that can makes your heart feel so calm &amp; warm. It’s the same feeling when you’re wrapped in a cozy blanket in your bed and you feel like everything is okay,so safe in your own world. You can find comfort in his deep, soulful &amp; healing voice.[#호비생일ㅊㅋ]
