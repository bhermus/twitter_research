rt in 5 secs and you'll pass this sem.‚ú®yooo i'm so tired of youtubers thinking they know more about running a multi billion dollar website (youtube) than youtube themselves. such immature, entitled, egotism.Y‚Äôall were hating PewDiePie for mocking the media‚Äôs portrayal of him but are defending Logan Paul for filming a dead body &amp; uploading it to his audience of children. Something doesnt add up. #CancelLoganPaul1998: the teens are calling everything gay
2008: the teens aren't sure they should be really calling things gay
2018: the teens are calling everything gay again, but in a positive way this timeLogan Paul monetized his apology video. 

Please do not watch it. That is all.And to all the #logang4life people if you are defending someone who laughed at someone who commited suicide then I recommend that you look in the mirror and rethink who you watch.things logan paul could have done:

-not show a dead body on the internet
-not show a dead body on the internet 
-not show a dead body on the internet 
-not referred to his youtube videos as "15 minute television shows"Logan Paul: I‚Äôm sor-
Twitter: https://t.co/qFvPe0fyRewhat YouTube needs to do with logan paul https://t.co/yB8BuxsTLmLogan Paul's apology letter amounts to:
- I didn't do it for success I'm successful already
- I laughed at that dead body and zoomed in to raise awareness
- I make too many videos to think about what I upload

He's not sorry about his insensitivity. He's sorry he got called out.In 2018 we will:
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan Paul
-Not support Logan PaulLogan Paul's main purpose of that video was NOT to spread a message.
Logan Paul's apology is NOT acceptable enough.
Logan Paul saw something horrific and real and thought he could get more views than normal out of it. Saying it was to "spread a message" is sick.oh hey i fucked up on my vlog lemme jus uhhhhhhhhhh write this note bullshitting an apology bc i need them fans 2 stay lmao oh the guy in my vid? fucc that man im the victim here the entire internet's bullying me lmao #DabOnThemHaters yoloswagHEY. YOUTUBE. DON'T PLAY FAVOURITES. #giveloganastrike @YouTube https://t.co/xoXrMMUaTDAn extremely dangerous narcissistic response. Never mentions the victim, the family, suicide prevention, mental health, or any signs of general remorse. Just a bunch of ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚Äúme‚Äù. This is an apology on aspects that affect him and him alone. Absolutely heartbreaking. https://t.co/eZ1TbiT4w0@LoganPaul Kids watch you man. Think about that the next time you‚Äôre editing your ‚ÄòTV show‚Äô.Non-apology, exactly as predicted. You really are scum, Logan.Amazing how Logan Paul can straight up  record a dead body of someone who hung himself without getting any trouble from YouTube but LGBT+ people can't even upload a video without it being demonized#GiveLoganAStrike 
Okay this video may be removed
BUT:
-Think about how many children saw this
-Think about the family of this man and how they currently feel 
-Think about how many people got triggered by this video, how many people had panic attacks because of this!‚ÄîRather than bashing Logan Paul anymore, I'll use this situation for awareness.

Suicide is real. Suicide is devastating.

If you're struggling, please reach out, this isn't the end. https://t.co/FyMdYivjwFAnother thing that really bugs me is how a lot of his audience is just okay with it? ‚ÄúHe blurred his face so it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù NO. No it‚Äôs not fine! At all! That video never should‚Äôve been uploaded. Imagine if that was someone you knew. He used this persons death as clickbait.Relationships can‚Äôt be built on sarcasm. Tell your friends and loved ones how much you care about them and MEAN IT.Videos will be late today! Spending some quality time with family and visiting my dad‚Äôs grave and such.
