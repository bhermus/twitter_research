.@JURICKSONPROFAR TRIPLES AGAIN!

We take a 7-6 lead in the 7th! https://t.co/OkadyD9c2RKiner-Falefa is my dude, yo!Matt Moore shouldn't even make it to the dugout still a RangerWhy is Matt Moore still pitching for my Rangers baseball club?I was repeatedly told that the Parkland shooter was never in the Promise Program I was asking questions about. Now it turns out that in fact he was.  https://t.co/q1JTbDXoU3So anti-gun advocates lied about where I was all weekend and hired JV bodyguards to run people out of parks if they asked questions. Good advocacy, money well spent 👍🏼When Tom Herman arrived at Texas, QB was a major issue. Now, Texas has 4 options. RB was an issue. Now, Texas has 5 options this fall.Then why did God make them delicious https://t.co/NT8zqIdROzTHE KING DOES IT AGAIN!!!!

#HookEm https://t.co/KUueNcAg9BDown East lefty Locke St John entered the 9th in a tie game with the bases full, 1 out. Struck out 2 straight. I promise I didn’t make up that name.I asked my daughter to fetch me a phone book ...

She says, “you’re so old fashioned Dad” and handed me her smart phone instead ...

Long story short ... the spider is dead, my daughters phone is shattered, and now she’s crying and tattling on me to her mom 🤣🤣
