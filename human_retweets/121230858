Something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is how, as more and more diverse books get published, I see more and more identity policing happening. 

I know it’s not going to stop but it’s dangerous.

If I ❤️ your pitch today, please send your query + 10 page sample to wgu@janklow.com, with #PITMAD in the subject line.Roy Moore won’t talk to the media, won’t talk to voters, won’t campaign, won’t debate, and couldn’t even handle me calling him embarrassing- he thinks he gets a free pass to the senate even with his disturbing history.
