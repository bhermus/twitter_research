His friends final moments were in my brothers arms. Rick Santorum is out of touch with the reality if he thinks CPR will do ANYTHING for most victims.@eugenegu On January 1st 2017, my brother witnessed his best friend commit suicide via a bullet to the head. My brother called 9-11 immediately and the operator instructed him on how to preform CPR. My brother took off his shirt and wrapped it around his friends now dismembered head,As a surgeon, I’ve operated on gunshot victims who’ve had bullets tear through their intestines, cut through their spinal cord, and pulverize their kidneys and liver. Rick Santorum telling kids to shut up and take CPR classes is simply unconscionable.Merecido!! A Sofia é uma menina da qual iremos ouvir falar com certeza.
