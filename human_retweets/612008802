‘I firmly believe that Martial is the best young player on the planet and will be as good as, or better than Cristiano Ronaldo. If Mourinho sells him, it’ll be the biggest mistake in his career or the club’s history. He is the rebirth of Jesus in human form.’

- Martial FCDavid de Gea (4.08) has a higher saves per goals conceded ratio than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League this season.

Dave well and truly saves. 🙌 https://t.co/HHR60GlReGGoals and assists this season: 
Pogba -  6 goals - 10 Assists
Vidal -    8 goals - 2 Assists
Modric - 2 goals - 5 Assists
Kroos -   4 goals - 7 Assists
Kante -   1 goal - 1 Assist https://t.co/DfKcElELdlSince Guardiola, Conte and Mourinho came to the PL: 

Guardiola, spent £473m, trophies: 1 
Conte, £320m, trophies: 1
Mourinho, £304m, trophies: 2

Overcriticised. Underrated.Martial wants to leave? He should be patient and stay: https://t.co/OKNNFNcXQv @ESPNFC https://t.co/yPNW2DnoKs"It isn't Paul Pogba FC"
"It isn't Martial FC"
"It isn't Luke Shaw FC"

But is it Jose FC tho?Let this sink in, ONLY Lukaku (34) has been directly involved in more goals than Martial (21) this season. Jose that.Ashley Young’s tackle on Sergio Aguero was not a penalty. If this is a penalty in your mind you need to reassess how you watch football. https://t.co/Xs1qmLaNY2Plenty of talk this season about Ederson rivalling De Gea. 
De Gea makes saves he simply has no right to - again and again.
He’s changing goalkeeping in the manner of Schmeichel 20 years ago. 
He’s the undisputed No1 in the worldIn a derby where United won from 2-0 down, Smalling scored the winner and De Gea beggared belief with that Aguero save, Martin Atkinson refereeing in #mufc''s favour was maybe the most remarkable occurrence.Like the majority, thought the result was a forgone conclusion at half-time. May have to get used to United comebacks again. Smalling’s resilience commendable after his ditzy mistake. #mufcMan Utd are the first team to come back from two goals down to beat Man City in the #PL since Liverpool in October 2008 #MCIMUN https://t.co/Dcgtdho6KALadies and gentlemen, your #MUFC Man of the Match on derby day...

#MCIMUN https://t.co/AunN1h8PKRDe Gea is a joke. What a game. It’s got everything.Gary Neville says Paul Pogba 'doesn't help himself' over his blue hair colour. It's an open goal after Guardiola's comments but he dyed it ahead of France duty and if Pogba had changed it to red last night it'd have been 'He spends too much time on his hair'. #mufcPaul Pogba: Manchester United reveal TRUTH about Pep Guardiola's Man City transfer claim #MUFC #MCFC #MCFCvMUFC

They’ve won the League with ease and cup, won’t affect their status this season in anyway really.Imagine if Mourinho and #MUFC lost 3-0 at Liverpool without a single shot on target.0 - Manchester City failed to direct a single shot on target in a game for the first time since 26th October 2016 (v Man Utd in the League Cup).

I don't think anyone would dispute that with him. Build team around those three players and buy the players that will assist Lukaku who has still shone while we have struggled.He *deserves* patience but in 18 mths the football has not changed. We are gambling a lot on assuming the football will improve with investment in full-back positions and central midfield. But look at how many Lvg players remain/will remain at the club? All the money/time wasted.I'm of the belief Shaw isn't good enough for us long-term anymore, he's not the same player he was pre-leg break and his mentality has obviously been affected. However, he's still better than Ashley Young and should be playing ahead of him IMO.Most @EmiratesFACup goals since start of March 2014

Have to recruit smartly in midfield and defence this summer. No excuses.@D_WarEagle Before Pogba's injury he was supposedly our only world class player, he was fabulous, best stats in Europe, best MF'er in PL, we won every game 4-0. Then we were shit without him, a 'one-man-team'. When we finally managed to overcome being shit without him, he is a problem?@absentdaddy “He’s one of the best holding midfielders I’ve ever seen in my life by far.
