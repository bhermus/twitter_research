I refuse to discuss my friend, @SenJohnMcCain’s funeral. But seems to me whether ur Barbara Bush, McCain, Jane Doe or Joe the Plumber, we all have the right to have whomever the hell we want at our funeral. For the record, I don’t want Trump at mine either https://t.co/iipZeo24khRunning a little late and trying to catch-up on news. Has Rudy Giuliani said anything crazy yet, today?Wow, Donald, John dislikes you so much he directed his family to bar you from his funeral -- while still alive. Proof most of America hates you because you are an ignorant, arrogant, self-centered, no-so-bright as$hole https://t.co/rQ76ebeYME @potus @realdonaldtrump #McCainMcCain At The Ranch:

He deeply regrets not picking Lieberman for VP in ‘08, tells Biden to stay in politics and is planning on having Pence, not Trump, at a funeral all hope won’t come anytime soon 

https://t.co/AmX1BL3ieu.@realDonaldTrump claimed that the NRA convention yesterday claimed, “This is your record crowd, you know, all time record crowd. You do know that, so, just remember." In 2013, there were 86,000 in attendance. There were 80,000 estimated yesterday.Happy prom to all the seniors at MSD. Stay safe, hope you all have an incredible time!!! Carmen, Nick, Meadow, and Joaquin are there with you. @PrincipalMSD ❤️Watching some fantastic coverage of the NRA convention. 

What a sad, sad circus that is... Celebrating and aggrandizing weapons like the one that killed so many in my school and far too many alike.The President of the United States funneled hush-money to a porn actress, days before election, to help his campaign.
The President of the United States &amp; those around him, lied, then covered up the lies for months.
Is Congress going to investigate? Republicans, I’m talking to u.@JNHMGR @OnTheCaseMan @joshtpm Let's add one more.

The final sentence of this opinion piece says "What the NRA's opponents hate isn't the organization. It's the millions of American voters who support it." WRONG!!! It is the NRA leadership.If you guys would like help get our politicians working for us and not the NRA tag any elected person from your mayor to your senator and ask them to sign the @noNRAmoney pledge!Re-elected Class Prez for senior year :’)While drawing your family in school for a project, your 14 year old sister should still be holding hands with you. But instead, she was taken by gun violence. This needs to change and it needs to change now. https://t.co/UKTad6F7h9Hey @Emma4Change, we could not be more proud to see you fight for a safer America. 🙌 Know there are 40,000 queer women in your corner. 💪🏽 Join your squad IRL? 👊🏾

#LWTSUMMIT https://t.co/f8nhYSM8cvThe kids are here to stay and so is change. As @BarackObama said
“Our future isn’t written for us, but by us.” I say make it a good story for your kids and the history books because it’s the only one you got. https://t.co/hMpBXOvtgMDon’t listen to those who try to oppress you. The young people will win and we will create a better, safer world than the one we were forced in to. It won’t be easy. We might grow weathered and weary. But we will never stop fighting. 

#NEVERAGAIN #MarchForOurLivesChange only comes when there’s a Congress that’s willing to accept that change.

It would be nice if he tweeted about the Black hero who saved lives. But unless it’s a Muslim, he doesn’t tweet about something like that,” @donlemon on CNN."Human nature cannot be prevented through laws or policy."

Please, @dloesch, explain to us why the United States has a 25 times higher rate of gun homicide than other high income countries? We're just more evil? Or could it be that we have 300 million guns and too few gun laws? https://t.co/1demDd6xVZ“Seeking the truth, finding the truth, telling the truth and living the truth has been, and always will be what guides my actions.” 
@amnesty @yourrightscamp @RAVisionMedia https://t.co/iYMDZ5dGATThere is so much work ahead. None of this would be happening without the support all of you. Thank you so much because of you change is coming, I can feel it.Trump promoted a racist “birther” conspiracy questioning Obama’s legitimacy. Melania stood by her husband’s insanity &amp; parroted Trump’s stupid birther claim. And here is Obama being gracious to her. Say whatever the hell you want about they guy, this is a gracious &amp; classy move. https://t.co/vhCtBGIC4fCan someone get this on Paul Ryan’s desk before he goes to his next fundraiser? 

CC: @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/IBaKaYN4K3This is why this conversation isn’t just about school safety. This is why adding security measures to our schools is only a baby step in curing the epidemic of gun violence in our country.  https://t.co/stLD2SLGFhThis shooting did not happen in a school, but did happen in a restaurant. Another case of someone who should not have been able to have access to an AR 15. Gun safety is about our rights and those rights have now been terminated for several people.

The only thing that is anywhere near as satisfying to me as common sense gun reform is pure efficiency..@JaclynCorin just quoted a statistic that only 1 in 5 people age 18-29 vote. We are going to change that!!  #VoterRegistration https://t.co/KowsNQbo2x@Emma4Change Grammar rocks!!!Maybe it's just me...the more I hear from @comey, the more conflicted I feel. I want to believe him that this is all about loyalty to country and inviolable respect for the truth. But damn, the guy has a big ego, is selectively inconsistent. I find him obnoxiously self-righteous.The NRA likes to claim it’s not peddling guns by fostering and promoting a gun culture. Weapons are what they‘re trying to sell; we’re just the collateral damage. Sensible gun owners all around the country are being manipulated by millionaires like Wayne LaPierre. https://t.co/ahnvLeikbSHate seeks to increase entropy through the destruction of relationships and the physically world.  Yet as humans our one defining characteristic is our ability to slow it by creating order through love. Hate is not what makes us human, it’s love.Unstable Donald Trump, a man who always ends up lying and out of whack (he is not normal!) will go down as the WORST PRESIDENT in history, by far! https://t.co/3Gi8PdVukuZIOOOONN YESSS GET IT https://t.co/sTHPXPkTiSMet @casforachange last night @RelayForLife at Douglas she’s awesome y’all should check some of the stuff she’s doing on her twitter https://t.co/yoTl40snna2 months ago I also lost my friend Carmen, and didn’t know that I would never see her again for several days after. No one will go through what everyone who has been touched by gun violence has gone through when we are through with fixing America. #MSDStrongBipartisanship=We all think that this was the worst possible thing President Trump could’ve done. 

Congratulations, United States! We’re pretty together on this one. https://t.co/tRkH824emiThe greatest evidence of #Idiocracy is that @realDonaldTrump's approval rating today stands at 39%. 

A man whose Administration openly flaunts corruption, dishonesty, incompetence, malfeasance &amp; the undermining of the rule of law today is approved by over a third of Americans.Two months today. It doesn’t get easier. It gets harder. Jaime Guttenberg I miss you with all of my heart. I will love you forever. If I have any Facebook friends who are against universal background checks before being allowed to purchase a gun, PM me so that we can discussTwo months ago today, I took the first picture at 2 pm. My best friend @emilygrusky and I were delivering carnations for V-day. The second picture was taken at 3 pm. Our world changed forever in a matter of minutes...&amp; now, we will never stop fighting. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/zoSwsRJkhSSome people think there is no such thing as racial profiling. That it is made-up or an exaggeration. It’s not. This type of thing still happens in America. People get arrested for doing nothing...but being black or being Hispanic.

@Starbucks, you got some explaining to do. https://t.co/f1yo8akksW6 days until the #NationalSchoolWalkout - be sure to wear orange because it is the color for resistance against Gun Violence and it symbolizes how our schools are becoming more like prisons 🧡Two months after 17 people at my school were robbed of life by a gunman wielding a weapon of war, new life has been breathed into a battle that was once believed to be a lost cause. We will never forget those we’ve lost and we will never stop fighting for what is right.@davidhogg111 I love reading David’s tweets in his voiceWhy are we focusing so much on the people verbally attacking us, when there are people dying of gun violence each day: focus on the important news. https://t.co/jZyWCEu5wDDear @NRA,

The candidate survey you just sent me went straight in our recycling bin.

I’ll never in a million years accept your endorsement or your money.

I want your political power eliminated for good.

Enough is enough. https://t.co/9BfT3H5Yv0Remember to get people registered to vote at your walk out! Sign up here! https://t.co/KGDJoXYNrhGov. Phil Scott of Vermont has been a responsible gun owner for decades &amp; has an A rating from the NRA. When he heard there were threats of a school shooting, he took action by banning bump stocks &amp; magazines larger than 10 rounds for a long gun and 15 for a handgun, (1/3) https://t.co/HoxXiEaZleToday is David’s birthday and I’m gonna ask him what he wants and he’s gonna say “I want you to vote” or “Justice” or “universal background checks” or something and I’m gonna get him a gift certificate.

This is exactly what will happen.HAPPY BIRTHDAY @DAVIDHOGG111 !! 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊 u can finally buy a Shamwow™️ without your parents permission :’-) they grow up so fastWhy I will keep fighting to bring Film jobs back to Florida! More than $875 million have been lost in Florida-in the last two years, often to states like Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. https://t.co/Nh44WtrRBD.@SpeakerRyan now you can put country over party and allow a vote on universal background checks 🙂 over 90% of Americans support it why not allow a vote on it?

Do you know about the #NorthwesternWalkout? It’s the school where two students died that you still haven’t made a statement about? Well it’s a mere 30 minutes from your alma mater. You’d think an issue so close to home would be addressed. https://t.co/TVrCIRLdH0#LibertyCity is on my mind, sadly not for the usual reasons. We gotta use this grief, take it in our hands and mold the future with it; the best way to feel relief from pain is to prevent it from happening to anyone else. Injustice Anywhere is Injustice Everywhere. #LibertyStrongRick Scott signed nothing in regards to gun reform after Pulse.

612 days later. Parkland happens. 

Did he say anything about Liberty City? 

Rick Scott has done more for the NRA than for the lives of his constituents.

He is an unjust, immoral politician. https://t.co/OGvSj5BCvJ#PresidentLoco began talking about Syria, which is good. International community must focus on this crisis and take action. But then, he predictably went off the rails, into stream-of-consciousness babble. Wall. NAFTA. China. Farmers. Esta loco, loco, loco.There were 612 days between the Pulse shooting in Orlando and the shooting at my school in Parkland. For those 612 days, @FLGovScott did nothing to fix the issue of gun violence. Now that he’s announced his senate run I’d like to know if he has any plans to fix things nationally.Another shooting near Liberty Square.

That community welcomed me with open arms and just a few blocks from the incredible town hall we had, children have died from gun violence.

We need to save the youth.

Stand in solidarity with #LibertyCity and demand change with us.Ready for school!! https://t.co/9niQ9IjXE2My #MondayMotivation stems from the lives lost in Liberty Square yesterday. Two dead, two injured...four families &amp; one community in mourning. We stand with Liberty City in this fight, even though the media at large refrains from covering this tragedy. #MarchForOurLivesHope you all are configuring your own #MarchForOurLives local action clubs at your school/in your community! Happy Sunday, hope you all have a productive week 💛✨ https://t.co/Z09CsPcEtMHey @realDonaldTrump remember this colorful guy they once called, "The Teflon Don," who was thought untouchable from prosecution despite his criminal past &amp; obvious crimes?
