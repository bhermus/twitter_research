https://t.co/AmX1BL3ieu.@realDonaldTrump claimed that the NRA convention yesterday claimed, ‚ÄúThis is your record crowd, you know, all time record crowd. You do know that, so, just remember." In 2013, there were 86,000 in attendance. There were 80,000 estimated yesterday.Happy prom to all the seniors at MSD. Stay safe, hope you all have an incredible time!!!

What a sad, sad circus that is... Celebrating and aggrandizing weapons like the one that killed so many in my school and far too many alike.The President of the United States funneled hush-money to a porn actress, days before election, to help his campaign.
The President of the United States &amp; those around him, lied, then covered up the lies for months.

Please, @dloesch, explain to us why the United States has a 25 times higher rate of gun homicide than other high income countries? We're just more evil?

CC: @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/IBaKaYN4K3This is why this conversation isn‚Äôt just about school safety. This is why adding security measures to our schools is only a baby step in curing the epidemic of gun violence in our country.  https://t.co/stLD2SLGFhThis shooting did not happen in a school, but did happen in a restaurant. Another case of someone who should not have been able to have access to an AR 15. Gun safety is about our rights and those rights have now been terminated for several people.

I find him obnoxiously self-righteous.The NRA likes to claim it‚Äôs not peddling guns by fostering and promoting a gun culture. Weapons are what they‚Äòre trying to sell; we‚Äôre just the collateral damage.

Do you know about the #NorthwesternWalkout? It‚Äôs the school where two students died that you still haven‚Äôt made a statement about? Well it‚Äôs a mere 30 minutes from your alma mater. You‚Äôd think an issue so close to home would be addressed. https://t.co/TVrCIRLdH0#LibertyCity is on my mind, sadly not for the usual reasons. We gotta use this grief, take it in our hands and mold the future with it; the best way to feel relief from pain is to prevent it from happening to anyone else. Injustice Anywhere is Injustice Everywhere. #LibertyStrongRick Scott signed nothing in regards to gun reform after Pulse.

612 days later. Parkland happens. 

Did he say anything about Liberty City? 

Rick Scott has done more for the NRA than for the lives of his constituents.

He is an unjust, immoral politician. https://t.co/OGvSj5BCvJ#PresidentLoco began talking about Syria, which is good. International community must focus on this crisis and take action. But then, he predictably went off the rails, into stream-of-consciousness babble. Wall. NAFTA. China. Farmers. Esta loco, loco, loco.There were 612 days between the Pulse shooting in Orlando and the shooting at my school in Parkland. For those 612 days, @FLGovScott did nothing to fix the issue of gun violence. Now that he‚Äôs announced his senate run I‚Äôd like to know if he has any plans to fix things nationally.Another shooting near Liberty Square.

That community welcomed me with open arms and just a few blocks from the incredible town hall we had, children have died from gun violence.

We need to save the youth.
