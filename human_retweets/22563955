Michael Jordan: 7/15 (47%)
Kobe Bryant: 5/22 (23%)
LeBron James: 12/23 (52%)

In a class of his own https://t.co/RStWD5vysuIs LeBron the GOAT? 

RT: Yes 
LIKE: No https://t.co/m3Bp40iXQpWhen Lebron and Jordan fans are arguing and then Kobe fans join in. https://t.co/9dZQdmr3RNThis will forever be the best video on the internet üòÇüòÇ https://t.co/2rgsZgwvk3What was more ice cold: LeBron‚Äôs shot or this kid calling it? https://t.co/JbsmyfgXGGI remember how bitter I was they installed dishwashers in the senior dorms at Davidson the year after I graduated. I imagine for recent UK grads, this is 100x worse.Already seeing people trip over themselves to say ‚ÄúBill Self didn‚Äôt know!‚Äù Same people who shred Calipari for Camby &amp; D-Rose. Camby has always said Cal never knew. Rose was cleared by NCAA. Hypocrites everywhere.#BBN, have you enjoyed breakfast the last couple days? We like to be transparent at Kentucky, but let me say this: No one truly knows what we are doing until it‚Äôs done. Finished yet?There is officially a new best transfer option on the market, IMO. https://t.co/AD5CH5Zq3BThank you Sacha! #fam #BBN https://t.co/XkweFCJfThNick Faldo just said ‚ÄúPatrick Reed is so superstitious, he won‚Äôt go to bed until he has closed every door in his house‚Äù

I don‚Äôt see that as superstition but just good life adviceI told a coworker that she penciled in her eyebrows too high. 

She seemed surprised.There's a storm brewing in Lexington. https://t.co/HmT6iU0p8AMe: Why Marvin Bagley aint in the game Duke trippin ! 
Friend: Thats Villanova bruh 
Me: https://t.co/ZCRKeA4eTsGrant Hill trying to make this feel like a game 

‚ÄúKansas can settle down here and start a run‚Äù

*Nova 3*

‚ÄúIf Kansas can get a stop and then attack the basket‚Äù

*Nova 3*

‚ÄúKansas is right in this and can get it down to single digits if they hit 15 shots in a row‚Äù

*Nova 3*PJ Washington played with a broken finger, will have surgery and never complained. Tough kid https://t.co/OfPC9G58eLDuke was preseason #1 &amp; didn't win the ACC regular season, didn't win the ACC Tournament &amp; didn't make the Final Four. 

Can't wait to not read all the "Coach K underachieved with this team!" articles that won't be written because this is Coach K/Duke instead of Coach Cal/UK.What a catastrophic failure by Duke. Having that much talent and you can't even reach the final four? I guess K is just a good recruiter and not an X and O's guy?

Am I doing this right?@timsnyder23 Yeah, all those Final Fours and Elite Eights by Kentucky aren‚Äôt worth it, huh? Please. There is not one way to do things. Over 300 D1 teams don‚Äôt have freshman stars, and they don‚Äôt win more than UK.There were several false reports last night that our players didn‚Äôt shake hands after the game. Our student-athletes did shake hands with the K-State staff while the team was celebrating. Good luck to @KStateMBB and @RamblersMBB in the Elite Eight. https://t.co/lvo8tQjcMEClosing book on the 2018 squad w/ this: Cal did an amazing job w/ this group. Can‚Äôt forget where they were a month ago, getting waxed by Florida. No J-Vanderbilt or J-Baker essentially for the season. End of last game wasn‚Äôt great coaching or player decision-making.One thing I do know, is the fans who gave up on this team in December and January are mostly the same ones angry tonight. You can‚Äôt all have it both ways and p.s. you all suck.Spinzone for Kentucky fans. When you‚Äôre one of the best programs and always relevant, bad losses in big moments will happen. Better than irrelevancy https://t.co/qy1grJaHPiOh, and that technical on Cal for being outside of the coaching box when Weber was outside his box 150x ... fucking joke.Kansas State was 1-12 from downtown the other night. So of course they have 6 threes tonight at halftime.SGA goes top 10 and Cal will be turning away 5 star point guards till the end of time.Interesting since in past its appeared committee stacked deck against UK. You know what they call the person who graduates last in med school? Doctor. https://t.co/ybtdyUu1QQWe didn't. https://t.co/iRV0IsPZWBNever want to hear he can‚Äôt coach again.   Lost 4 straight.  Won SEC and in Sweet 16 with his ‚Äúworst team ever‚Äù.  Get bentShai Gilgeous-Alexander should drive to the rim every possession the final 7:30 of this game.SGA to the rack for 7 minutes sounds like a solid offensive plan to me....and then they handed the Coach of the Year trophy to the guy that just lost to a 16 seed. https://t.co/ObYKCcThGfSEC tourney was fun.Clark Kellogg just said Davidson needs to close the gap or Kentucky will extend their lead. https://t.co/SocfFaixZoI‚Äôve seen a lot of people sticking up for Ted, but I think it‚Äôs totally appropriate for the NCAA to send the message that they don‚Äôt want a ref making himself the story https://t.co/VqXePQvoGIUK about to have another Freshman PJ Washington to go along with the junior version they‚Äôll have üòÇMeanwhile in Louisville... https://t.co/WRDJSTL0f7Youngest team in college hoops. One of the toughest schedules in the country. Injuries all year. Toughest SEC in decades. And Kentucky is SEC champs. Put simply, this is the best coaching John Calipari has ever done at Kentucky. Period.If coaching is having your team playing its best basketball in March, I'll take John Calipari.Watching Kentucky, I wonder how many times they must obliterate assumptions about investment in team &amp; program before disinformation stops.What an embarrassment. We should be there every year! https://t.co/pgmIQsJtfdKentucky has now reached the finals of the SEC Tournament in 8 of 9 years under John Calipari. Anyone still suffering from one and done fatigue?Kentucky is the youngest team in the country, dealt with injuries all year + played the 2nd toughest schedule nationally. They've now won 6 of 7 and will play for an SEC title. I really dont think we're giving enough credit to John Calipari for the coaching job hes done this yearMy annual pick for favorite freshman this season goes to PJ Washington.Dad: "Boy, UK sucks"
Also Dad: "I haven't watched a single game"
Me: https://t.co/BFnAGqJyyNLol no https://t.co/9MvEgL0t38https://t.co/wElOys5iaiLouisville's loss is honestly one of the funniest things I've ever seen.Never thought I'd be one to make long threads, but I need to tell someone about the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me. 8 weeks ago, I was working in private security as a guard for multiple contracts. My most frequent was for a manufacturing plant. I'm (1/10)Spurs coach Gregg Popovich finally gets around to his thoughts on Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham who said LeBron should ‚ÄúShut Up &amp; Dribble.‚Äù As usual, this is a beatdown (via @CavsGregBR) https://t.co/O3h8BVE5tJKentucky wins its third game in a row, and is once again peaking heading into March. Its almost like at some point, we should stop questioning John Calipari's ability to get a young team to figure things out by tournament time or something.Quade Green settling in at PG and Jarred Vanderbilt getting comfortable ... hmm ... UK's play starting to have a familiar look to it as the calendar nears a certain month.I had forgotten that Kevin Knox turned down $1.5 million to play this season in China. Yeah, I doubt his family needed a few thousand bucks to go to a certain college program, especially since they are reportedly not exactly struggling. Having someone buy your lunch is nothing.#LaFamilia https://t.co/y9oY2YZqYDLive Now: Kentucky-Alabama Postgame https://t.co/TEZ1QSPiK7Season-saving win for Kentucky today. Best they have looked in a month? Hmm ... Bama is legit, too. Very talented.I wish they were undefeated.  I just can‚Äôt bring myself to give up.  It‚Äôs fun being a fan. I still love all of you that get super negative.  I totally understand because I used to do the sameYou can see them shutting down before your eyes. It's that one spell they talked about all week leading up to this game.6-4. and now you know why you have to move the seat forward when your mom lets you borrow her car. https://t.co/jCHCV081ikNot even 2 pm and the award for dumbest Fan Tweet of the day is already locked up https://t.co/lqTkoXDJkrUK is 17-7, 6-5 in the SEC. In 2011, UK was 17-7, 5-5 in the SEC. A few weeks earlier, Terrence Jones was a selfish MFer. Remember that? That team rallied to get a 4 seed and made the Final Four. Be patient.@_VinceCali He won‚Äôt be fired, but he won‚Äôt be around long either. He doesn‚Äôt deserve this sort of stupidity.Louisville has lost 3 consecutive games.

This is the program's longest losing streak since losing 152 consecutive games between 2010 and 2014.LOL https://t.co/PZqkcs9fhAThinking about different ways we can help in Marshall Co. Great way are these shirts, which you can purchase from @shoplocalky at the https://t.co/R0K3DRaRGh. Full proceeds go to The Kentucky Lake CVB, which will get them directly to the families of the victims. #MarshallStrong https://t.co/MKMzUnQ2KaThat's this UK team for you.  Just enough to give you a taste, but never enough to get you full.You rarely see an arena put the home team to sleep. Good job Rupp crowd.The demise of Kentucky has been greatly exaggerated.Man you all need to stop hating on Nick. He‚Äôs developing and playing his ass off.Knox slams ball after dunk, gets warning and talking to by ref. WVU player did same after 1st basket to help set up press and you guessed it....nothing.Damn it, boogie was about to start the ASG, first playoffs, and had put up Wilt numbers this week. Took down Houston with a triple double, then this. This isn‚Äôt fair.I‚Äôm literally sick for @boogiecousins Just heartbroken.All this guy ever wanted was to prove that he could contribute to winning situation. He didn't care about perception or anybody's opinion of him. He wanted to win because that was at the core of his crazy. He was getting there. This ain't fair. https://t.co/cIRuUxFsJVThinking about everyone in Marshall County. You‚Äôre on all of our minds here. #PrayForMarshall #MarshallStrong https://t.co/kciLe3egXjKentucky plays West Virginia Saturday. 

Wonder if Daxter Miles will talk trash again.

I'm guessing not. https://t.co/wxopLMUrO9How are you so bad at this, @dandakich https://t.co/1y3iwU0ubvI get the panic induced by the convergence of team and recruiting losses, but UK went from, what, a decade-plus of Tubby not landing top guys and Billy G offering 11-year-olds who grew up to be D3 players ... to freaking out when Calipari slides to No. 2 recruiter on the planet.In the Calipari era, both Duke and UK have played in two national championship games. K won both, Cal won one. In the other six seasons, Cal has been to four other Elite Eights, two more Final Fours ‚Äî and K got out of the Sweet 16 just once. NBA over winning is a fallacy. https://t.co/lDkYzSGGMABy the time Tubby left UK we had ONLY 3 and 4 year players. Billy Gillispie too. We couldn‚Äôt sniff a Final-4 and I remember ... fans were fed-up. 

People griping about Cal &amp; his recruiting are Basketball Morons (‚ÄòBasketball Bennies‚Äô). 

With all due respect. #BBNA closer view RT @classicchris77: @KySportsRadio @itsdstewtoyou Yep https://t.co/Sj83BFEKpnYeah, it‚Äôs the staff‚Äôs fault we‚Äôre losing recruits to duke. https://t.co/lvwBeqtX2DI‚Äôve seen ‚Äúfans‚Äù for 9 years say they want the players to stay in Lexington multiple years. Now they have a team full of kids who aren‚Äôt going anywhere, yet they bitch and moan for instant gratification. Cal can‚Äôt win with of these fools.No idea what Diallo has been doing out on the floor all night. Bad transition defense, bad zone defense, and lazy stuff like that intentional foul.I can't stop watching this. #HamiBall #NobodyLovesHamiLikeHamidou https://t.co/uudgc2nOYjKentucky is now 17 games into their season. They are 14-3 and had a chance to win every game they've played with five minutes to go. It hasn't always been pretty. But given UK's youth, fans should be happy with where this team is atAll four of the UK Defensive Juniors considering entering NFL Draft decided to return (Edwards, Allen, Jones, Ware)....huge for the UK programhttps://t.co/09WHw35AVkü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHope I'm wrong, but I think Kentucky gets the rare home L tonight.

Please mock me for this in about two hours.Cats, again. #WeAreUK https://t.co/zgs8GVWOsWJaelen Hurts has thrown 1 INT in 246 attempts this year. But let‚Äôs go with the true freshman who‚Äôs never played meaningful minutes.https://t.co/btN112m9Lehttps://t.co/PF51iUyH7vFaster than Rick Pitino https://t.co/yysCQpbCkJ
