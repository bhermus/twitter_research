#PremiosMTVMiaw #MTVBRFandomBTS https://t.co/foh1xah4bDhttps://t.co/Vz49URDboQOkay the fact Taehyung didn’t just work on set with the backup dancers but he literally met up with them, practiced, had lunch, and he basically got to know them whilst working with them. That makes me so happy, I love our little Social butterfly.I just had to make sure I- https://t.co/ek4nGIXHZ4namjoon just posted on fancafe saying that he wrote singularity once he came out from the hospital oh my god babyGrades: “i don’t feel so good” https://t.co/WNScxmSVlYif you ever feel dumb, just know that when my friend was 14 she went to a psychiatrist bc she “had a voice in her head”. it was her brain. like literally just her thoughts. she thought that she was the only person who had the ability to think. for 14 years.here’s taehyung raising his eyebrow to the beat of the music on loop bc we all need it #Singularity https://t.co/eN4O9gOCLWt'challa's reaction to shuri and okoye roasting him is my new favourite thing https://t.co/8ILjbeWeLqi want a fkin 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡KISS😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡And knowing Namjoon, he probably made a guide with him singing to show Taehyung how he imagined the song to be미친 김태형 정호석 무슨 연관있는지 찾아냄 정호석의 병명 : 뮌하우젠 증후군 뮌하우젠 증후군이란 헌신적인 부모라 불리고 싶어 자신의 아이를 남몰래 학대하는거임 그래서 부모의 사랑이 fake love라는거고 1번사진에서 김태형은 저 행동을 통해서 남이 자신을 사랑해주는거같은걸 표현=페이크러브 https://t.co/q8tiuwgVeDhttps://t.co/EOBfKdQDcmARE YOU FCKIGN KIDDING ME TAEHYUNG ALREADY PERFORMED A BIT OF SINGULARITY AT THE GDAs

WHERE THE HELL WERE WE WHAT THE FUCKBDS #singularity  https://t.co/U1axFspcpHthe fact that even sungdeuk himself, the choreographer of bts, confirmed that taehyung is now officially part of the dance line, this is another slap in the face of his haters. we love a multitalented king who was born to perform https://t.co/hoUekp2iLV.@StarWars Recognizes BTS Fan ARMY As Major Donors of Force For Change UNICEF Campaign https://t.co/fW0zipnFqC https://t.co/yqTSrCTqHmimagine serendipity and singularity contrast stage just like lie and boy meets evil at mamas https://t.co/9RGTp348M3NAMJOON WROTE IT IN ONE TAKE?!

It’s crushing it and taking over the world anyway. #Singularityhttps://t.co/PCMblv77H6THEY CONNECT GASP https://t.co/BWKCYWIBI4the crying mask (melpomene) muse of tragedy was originated from Greek ancient theatre, BTS didn't use it for "aesthetics" but for symbolism that goes hand in hand with the use of the references of classic and modern literature in the plots of their music videos and album themes https://t.co/3LGWJfB7sY『@BTS_twt』

Anderson's A/W 2010 combat boots are some kind of aesthetic. https://t.co/GZo0ynD1QmIf you didn't notice, the masks dancing around Taehyung make a heart shape, alluding to fake love, not showing the REAL you in a relationship, hiding behind a mask, which ties back to yoongi's lyrics in outro:tear, which ties to the theme of LY:tear

#Singularity @BTS_twtI told Felix i loved his freckles, but I couldn’t see it clearly because the make up covered it.

And then he wiped off his foundation. I was too shocked and asking why why.

He replied “For you”
