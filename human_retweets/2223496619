me as a 22yo: wow that apartment is huge ! and in central london ? i wonder how much the rent is ? do you think it's a flat share ?2017 was a year full of pain, but also so much growth and healing. 2018 will be a year of enjoying recovery and happiness and everything i worked so hard for. this is the aftermath #WelcometoMidnight @TWLOHA2018 will be a year of healing. I intend to find treatment for my mental health. I will treat my body with more care. I will learn to fall in love with myself. 2017 was rough; I'm looking forward to 2018. #welcometomidnight"... if you’re interested in mental health and trying to care for someone who’s dealing with a mental illness, I think it makes sense to try to learn.” -
