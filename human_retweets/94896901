© @BAMBOOSTICK_ https://t.co/z0MMGEujU8Louis wrote his album with the attention of being honest with himself, with us, with the world. Discovering all the words he used to put his emotions out will be an amazing experience.How am I supposed to sleep at night knowing moments like this one exist ?!?
And that was in front of cameras. Imagine how it must have been behind the scenes.... https://t.co/3lK21eypnKPLEASE HELP OUT MY THIRD HOUR &amp; RETWEET THIS!! https://t.co/aLPxlTM4veDo you sometimes think about the fact that maybe Louis knew since the early beginning what was going to happen ? That his four songs were clues to let us know that we just have to wait for him and trust him. Wait for the album with THE truth in it ? Bc I think about it a lot. https://t.co/oWpR2cKYloLOUIS TOMLINSON SABOTAGED BY HIS MANAGEMENT https://t.co/z90nBeL9Ezharry has 3 shows left until he has like two weeks off before the american leg and i hope he just sleeps the entire time because its what he deservesLet’s see your tattoos dedicated to @Louis_Tomlinson! 😎
