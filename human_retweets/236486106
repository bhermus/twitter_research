https://t.co/ZlUAs9CkPjI‚Äôd like to think when Wenger finally leaves Arsenal, he gets in a car, drives to a quiet pub &amp; there will be Sir Alex in a flat cap. Sir Alex says, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs been a hell of a run‚Äô. Wenger just nods &amp; smiles. They raise their glasses and toast to each other.

Messi caught up in better than crouch shock https://t.co/zdL8h4GWYuSpitting at the car is horrible. Anyone think he really means to spit in a girls face? Also - should you be driving/having bantz/filming whilst your daughter is in the car? Who keeps asking you to stop. Me - I‚Äôd worry about getting prosecuted more than going to the press.Totally out of order &amp; Ive apologised personally to all the family this evening.
