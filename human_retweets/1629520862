This photo of George H.W. Bush sitting in front of his beloved wife's casket pierced my soul.

George &amp; Barbara Bush were married for 73 years. They suffered through losing a child together. They made it to the WH together. They watched their son become president.

What a life. https://t.co/xSha0O0e8rthe fact that hotel windows only open a few inches is super smart and so safe but it just makes me a little scared to know that Mariah Carey still is at risk of being able to easily fall thru :'(It’s 2009. You’re watching Jersey Shore or Parental Control on MTV because your parents aren’t home from work yet. You have the remote set up so when you hit the “last” button, it immediately goes to Suite Life on Disney Channel. Life is good.@MariahCarey ILY!! ❤️❤️ “I’m part of you indefinitely” https://t.co/8qhpWEPyX5Baby laughing hysterically at pacifier noise https://t.co/W0BuMIM9H7just found the british equivalent of “stop i could of dropped my croissant” https://t.co/RhjWHdbzQzRT and I'll draw ur avi https://t.co/VUFkm2dDDri lowkey get sad when ppl say "I'll shut up now I'm being annoying sorry" when they're talking about something they love, bc someone has told them to "shut up already" or "enough we get it" when they talk about it, and they've just gotten conditioned into apologizing for nothingTRL PHOTOBOOTH // 2000 https://t.co/SzFfK3Fm44Gonna leave this video here https://t.co/s3kUed2cpTi'm almost 250% sure kanye smoked 9 blunts before this https://t.co/utZMbnDq1zI’m single so today is just WednesdayYou know Mariah Carey’s songs are the shit when you loose your breath just for lip syncing them.Mariah Carey is really the female Drake (GOAT)The internet deserves to see this https://t.co/YxwagYW0J0take me back to one of the best weeks of my life. 🌊✝️ https://t.co/EvLYVeO35cAm I the only one who only wanted to use these plates when I was little 😂 https://t.co/uT1YSKTUHFRT if you’re from the “real 419”
