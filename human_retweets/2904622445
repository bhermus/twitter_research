Unpopular opinion: general education courses in college are a complete scam for your money to keep you paying for 4+ yrs. If gen ed courses weren’t a requirement, majors really only require 2 yrs of classes. All of highschool was gen ed- it’s simply unnecessarycollege goodbyes are weird like am I gonna ever see you again? when? where? in what setting? your wedding? a casual run in? do I even get to say goodbye in the middle of finals? how does one say congrats &amp; good luck with the rest of your life without wanting to bawl????!If someone makes u second guess ur worth even the slightest bit.... move along hunnyYour Benz doesn’t make you hot or a decent person jsMorning view of @OhrstromLibrary @StPaulsSchoolNH https://t.co/SNtI5XK2vKLife gets so much better when you remove the dumb asses that don’t appreciate you from itClasses That SHOULD Be Mandatory in High School:
