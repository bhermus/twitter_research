But I'm just signalling it, because this shite is happening to othersAnd the sad thing is . As I tweet this they are in the group chat laughing at me .But I just think it's crazy how we let people away with things like thisAnd saying the worst things ever about my little nephew. Thank god I'm not the kind of person who thinks into stuff like thisBut the worst part is. They have been nothing but abusive . Saying things you wouldn't even believe about me and my familyFor the last two weeks I've been receiving messages off a group of fans, they have drowned my phone in messages, keeping me awake at nightCheck out my limited edition charity tee in support of @irishautism &amp; @RoseFoundation1
