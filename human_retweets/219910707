Hi friends, please help me graduate by answering my survey on brand perception.

Each response will be greatly appreciated. Thank you! https://t.co/GNm0r0PeVosocial media influencer lubog sa masa challengeThis is Erwin Tulfo. What he says in this video is directed towards a woman. The Chief Justice, no lessf. What is apparent is how he views women reflected in his poor choice of words.

No to misogyny. No to Erwin Tulfo. Take him out of the media. https://t.co/gqVXcayDYMYes gurl, bcos u kill them https://t.co/ITDy5ZS2ARhttps://t.co/0WWGNdrFiq and you’re so warm that it breaks my heart / melting me to mold into your shape and i am waiting on the day you’ll look into my eyes / wondering if you know / that i feel so lost when you are gone / slave through the day so you can make it to my armsCutie nito:
1. They don't need your acknowledgement. Buhay na nila ang oppression.
2. Stipend? Lol. How about providing them with a better livelihood, better wages?
3. FGDs? Really? Can we see the data? Or better yet, try to integrate with them rather than hold FGDs? https://t.co/NNIbIuASi1its 2018, can we retire the "we are the voice for those who cannot speak" ivory tower rhetoric already?
