Did I miss something? Did youtube stop allowing you to make good content?  Are they hindering your ability to grow an audience through hard work? If ur confident you have what it takes to be a full time youtuber you should be laughing at the threshold(1)Anyway. Conclusion: nobody is really affected by this, as a policy to stop what they claim they‚Äôre trying to stop it probably won‚Äôt work and Logan Paul is still on their site making money.

This is less Youtube being malicious and more Youtube being ineffectual useless dolts.‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the principle‚Äô. I‚Äôm still waiting for someone to identify what that principle actually is. Cos nobody is stopping you making youtube videos, and if you don‚Äôt ‚Äòcare about the money‚Äô (which you weren‚Äôt making anyway) then what is youtube preventing you from doing?YouTube just helped you and you don't want to listen... https://t.co/2kWga5xZdbAnimation: Shinya Ohira (Â§ßÂπ≥ Êôã‰πü)
