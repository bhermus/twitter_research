1 RT = 1 vote https://t.co/7V9hgjg0A9Unfortunately the @NFL doesn't identify Festivus, therefore I am required to work on such holiday. The silver lining is that my profession allows me to air my grievances with trash talk and display feats of strength.

So with that being said:

HAPPY FESTIVUS!!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 https://t.co/H0uIe2G9gv
