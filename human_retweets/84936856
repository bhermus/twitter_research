what women see: https://t.co/Tjlm2pn9Q0S/o to all my queens who love and respect themselves, support and encourage other females,mind their business &amp; are achieving their goals.In a relationship communication is key. Getting mad at your girl bc she's expressing what upsets her is lame af. Instead of flipping the situation &amp; blame on her, ask her where u went wrong &amp; how can u fix it. Even if it's not that deep to u, it could be a serious matter to her.Date someone who handles conflict with maturity. You both need to remember that it’s you and him vs the problem, not you vs him. It’s a team effort. You have to learn to communicate and come up with a plan on how to fix the situation.Imagine twerking calmly wit ya sundress flowing in the breeze , highlight blinging, cold glass of wine in ya hand all while Bickenhead blasts over the speakersI really do be speaking everything I do into existence and it be happening, your mind is so fucking powerful.

Give your heart to a guy who would never cause you to feel inferior in your relationship, because he’ll do everything his power to make you feel the oppositeBeing a Man means you don't have the luxury of winning a fight even when you're right. 
In fact being a man means you don't equate disagreements in a relationship to winning or losing instead-
Being a man is building bridges regardless of who broke them in the first place.A strong man that stands up for you and your relationship and fights for you and your relationship! Real hard to find..Gotta value mental connections more than a physical ones."Are you awake?"

me: https://t.co/xXD2qHTlaYDon’t forget who was there when you ain’t have nothing or nobodyDon’t invalidate people’s struggles because you’ve been through worse. If someone is tired after working for 5 hours and you worked for 7, it doesn’t mean that they’re not allowed to be tired. It doesn’t mean they can’t feel what they’re feeling just because you’ve had it worse.it’s ok to be nonchalant but not showing you care about things that matter to you just gon make you lose those things.I pray that you only desire God’s plan for your life. No matter what kind of hardships you have to endure to get it; may you never settle for anything less than what He predestined for you.
