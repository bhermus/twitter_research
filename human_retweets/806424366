#bethankful #ShoaibAkhtarSurprised &amp; disappointed at the Bar Council of India giving a clean chit to the lawyers who blocked the filing of challan in most abbhorant rape and murder of the little girl in #Kathua .It reminds one of the despicable whitewash of #KunanPoshpora horror by Press Council of IndiaThe most sincere people who pray for you are your parents. Its an unconditional love. May Allah help us fulfill our rights towards them. #Allah #Blessing #Life #Sincere https://t.co/T4zhop9bFxAlmighty. On this blessed day, help us truly understand that things work by Your schedule. Not ours. We tend to forget that. We’re always in a rush. That’s what this world has taught us. Sadly, we forget that one of the biggest life lessons You’re teaching us is patience!You may not know the future, but you know Allah and He holds the future, so don't worry. Pray and leave the rest to Him. #Muslims #Faith #life #IslamSir gadbad yeh hai ki ‘proud Hindu’  log, ek musalmaan bachchi ka rape kar rahey hain, uskey musalmaan parivaar ko common zameen sey hataaney ke liye, Mandir mein. Phir ministers pro rape rally mein Jai shri ram &amp; Bharat mata ki jai ki pukaar laga rahey hain 1/2 https://t.co/05Kaz97OH0Heartening to see the Supreme Court take cognisance of the attempted obstruction of justice by some lawyers in the brutal Kathua rape &amp; murder case reminding us once again of the greatness of this nation. 1/2#Kathua is about the rape &amp; murder of an EIGHT year old child &amp; the need to see justice done in this case. The rest of the noise is just an attempt at obfuscation.So if some of you want to defend the rape of a minor girl &amp; can live with yourselves after that be my guest but please don’t try to make it look like this a Hindus of Jammu v/s Muslims issue.Some people are determined to sell the binary that demanding justice for the victim of the #Kathua travesty is akin to calling every Hindu of Jammu a rape sympathiser.Whether 6yr old Zainab of Kasur or 8yr old Asifa of Jammu,these barbaric inhumane acts shud b condemned &amp; those behind shud be punished to the max,let these cases be a lesson for the culprits whr no daughter will ever be subjected to this henious act #NeverAgain #JusticeforAsifaImagine what goes through the mind of an 8 yr old as she is drugged, held captive, gang raped over days and then murdered. 
If you don’t feel her terror, you are not human. 
If you don’t demand Asifa get justice, you belong to nothing.I am Hindustan. I am Ashamed. #JusticeForOurChild #JusticeForAasifa 
8 years old. Gangraped. Murdered.
In ‘Devi’-sthaan temple. #Kathua and lest we forget #unnao Shame on us! #BreakTheSilence #EndTheComplicity #ActNow https://t.co/O8rABOrZq9First you rape and kill a eight year old girl; then you seek to protect the killers with the tricolour and Jai Shri ram slogans; then you engage in communal whataboutery. Our conscience is dead. I hang my head in shame. We all should. Not a shubhratri.No humanity left! Frightening to even read about the gory details of the heinous act on a fragile little girl! 
#JusticeForAsifa https://t.co/cBLyOZ5Keu"When the body of Asifa was brought here for burial, people from the village attacked us. They said they will not allow us to bury her here, else they will take back the land," said Mohammad Jan, Asifa's uncle 

#JusticeForAsifa

https://t.co/OND6Pz2mcSDeeply shocked at the callous murder of 8 yrs old Asifa, a victim of racial discrimination. It is appalling that the Indian ruling party BJP supporting the accused to terrorize Muslims in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. The @UN must assure #JusticeforAsifa to stop the atrocities in the region. https://t.co/ZcxEsgw45QExcessive laughing is disliked in Islam and as such, it should be avoided. Excessive laughing is when virtually everything becomes a joke. Nothing is taken seriously.
#Laugh #Islam #Muslims https://t.co/RTBQ1UJMeJLike millions of Indians my heart hurts tonight. India simply cannot continue to treat its women the way it does. 

Join me in a silent, peaceful, candlelight vigil at India Gate at midnight tonight to protest this violence and demand justice.I look at this first as a mother and it’s completely heartbreaking, as a woman I feel rage and as an Indian I am absolutely ashamed ! #JusticeForAsifa https://t.co/DNid9qz9R3How many more children like baby Asifa will be sacrificed at the intersect of religion &amp; politics? How many more children will have to suffer unimaginable crimes before we wake up? I’m disgusted. It’s time for swift action. We owe it to Asifa and to humanity.  #justiceforAsifa.These are not human beings, they are demons. The entire country should stand for #JusticeForAsifa. It is horrifying that such a crime could happen in India, that too in a place of worship. #AsifaBanoWe have failed as a society! Being a father, I am shaken and filled with anger reading about what happened to a 8 year old kid. My heart goes out to Asifa's family. I refuse to accept we really let THIS happen. Justice has to be served NOW. #JusticeforAsifaSorry Sister #Asifa ,We failed to save you 😔
Rapists &amp; murderers of Asifa deserves 1000s capital punishments and those who r defending/saving/supporting rapist of Asifa are scums of lowest grade n blot on humanity ! 
Every Indian MUST stand for #JusticeForAsifa ! https://t.co/F1dfmbDALw#justiceforasifa it’s so painful .words fail to manifest the shame and anger one feels reading the news of this horrific act .let your blood boil for this little one who we couldn’t give a safe place to grow in. https://t.co/UnX5AYZUADWe have found a double pumpkin for  the day; Nandakumar Chauhan, BJP MP from Khandwa says Asifa rape and murder is Pakistan 'conspiracy'. Utterly crazy, shameless and insensitive remarks. #JusticeForAsifaBefore you go to bed tonight read this heart wrenching piece by @nazir_masoodi of @ndtv. He is only TV journalist in entire state, who reported every aspect of this case, including interviewing Sanji Ram, the ring leader, before he surrendered.   
https://t.co/Tz8g9YMkmwThe cruelest form of evil is harming an innocent child. What is happening to the world we live in??? These people should be given the most severe punishment there is! Where are we heading as humanity? 
Shaken to my core.

State BJP ministers have openly backed the accused. What are you doing as a responsible opposition party? Where is your voice? Speak UP#Kathua : Kidnap,Sedated,Gang raped, Held captive in Temple, Performed rituals 2 avoid suspicion, Took her 2 Forest 2 eliminate, Policeman reaches spot &amp; asks them 2 wait as 'he wanted to rape her before she's killed'. She's later killed by hitting twice with a stone on her head. https://t.co/CZ3MB634D9Speak up against the horror of the #Kathua gang rape of an 8 year old -held captive in a  temple, drugged, raped, mutilated, killed, uterus damaged. She was a Child &amp; our flag was used to defend her rapists. Shame on the lawyers mob who blocked the court. https://t.co/4lTnX9Dm5WAn 8 year old child is drugged and held captive in a temple for 3 days. Brutally gang-raped to the extent her uterus is damaged.

(ابن ماجہ، بیہقی)Memorize this hadith people! Memorize it. Seriously, memorize it. 

God once revealed to Moses, “O Moses, the one who claims to love Me speaks a lie, for when night comes he sleeps and forgets Me. Is it not that every lover yearns to be alone with his beloved?”Make the last words of your day some type of remembrance of God. Always begin everyday with His name and end each day with His name . Gn
