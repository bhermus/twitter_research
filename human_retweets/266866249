Everyday I'm trying to improve myself mentally, physically, emotionally &amp; spiritually.👏Michael A. Ramos- a #Charlottesville Assailant of #DeAndreHarris GUILTY of aggravated assault. Will serve 10-20 years in prison. NEXT #WARONINJUSTICE #ITSONUS https://t.co/8d61UOhAspYOU are one of the best, stay that way.Me getting my feelings hurt but carrying on as usual as if nothing happened https://t.co/OTcVftIahphttps://t.co/i8OyInqHRHSince 1980, California has built 23 prisons, but only 4 universities and 9 community colleges. Housing one prisoner annually in California costs more than a year at Harvard. These priorities are backward. We should be investing in educating our youth, not incarcerating them. https://t.co/GOtynyNUTELook man can’t blame me for being me ....right ?ALL HANDS ON DECK.

1. White men kill the overwhelming majority of cops. 

2. Those same white men, armed and dangerous, are almost always taken in alive. 

Our police know how to avoid lethal force...when they want to.

#BeatLA | #SFGiants https://t.co/vFhf1inTNtWater is Life https://t.co/5kvaLMEa06White people who call the police on Black people for the most insignificant small reasons are fully aware that the police serve white interests and they're utilizing that awareness. This is an admission on their part that police are meant to uphold white supremacy.why is it a flex to spend almost a stack on junk/processed foods? https://t.co/bxsKNFec1ZEnough said.
