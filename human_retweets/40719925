Faith requires trust.

Will you trust God today even if you don’t understand the what and why?

Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; (Proverbs 3:5)“Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known.”

Jeremiah 33:3“Don’t forget to show love.” https://t.co/fgFQlMP4a1Three Friday tips from my dad:

He wants us to stay the course! Remember, where we direct our focus is where our steps will take us!We all have those times we wish the voice of God would audibly say, “This is the direction I want you to go.” We crave certainty.
