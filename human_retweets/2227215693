#ASRoma #UCLLiverpool FC • All 37 Champions League Goals https://t.co/i1m1JGm8GrMood https://t.co/xIOf2UUHalLive scenes coming out of Anfield tonight https://t.co/IblztvVoz5Henderson is defo the most replaceable player on our teamLiverpool’s goalkeeper and midfield not strong enough to get this done over two legs in my opinion. Control of the midfield key and Liverpool’s better without he ball. @Mancity to qualify but should be a cracker.There is only a few of us who can do that60 minutes gone at Goodison Park:

Kevin De Bruyne has had 14.2% of the possession.
Everton have had 16%.
