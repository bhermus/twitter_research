After a breakup the loyal ones will stay single and the cheater ends up with someone new😂 tell me I’m not lyingI've got a new challenge for everyone today. Pick somebody that you had an argument with that you think you hate maybe even someone you haven't spoken to in years and contact that person and tell them I love you.T’was the plan legoooo. https://t.co/dHymUXUPmYWe live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselvesget past the pastWho else’s parents speak Spanish but never taught you??Nobody our age values keeping their relationship or families together.
