Brace up and move forward!!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/3rjZQ2uO35I love myself as I am enough to be compassionate to myself. #Deep #LHC2017 https://t.co/IDd0V1foJsMy own way of saying this is "There is always a way". It's left for us to choose the path we want when it seems we are stranded. #LHC2017 https://t.co/E4eRACjXXN@sobafemi thank you so much Sir for the insight. We appreciate you sir. Thank you once for for your time... #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG so instead of wallowing in SELF PITY, I brace up and MOVE FORWARD #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG my BIGGEST ASSET is VULNERABILITY &amp; SELF-ACCEPTANCE. I LOVE MYSELF AS I AM ENOUGH TO BE COMPASSIONATE TO MYSELF #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG I also have grown an ATTITUDE that says I CAN NEVER BE STRANDED &amp; besides EVERYTHING ALWAYS ENDS WELL FOR ME #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG I have learnt to understand I AM DIVINE and I AM HUMAN. So I see limitations are NECESSARY JUNCTIONS on the JOURNEY #LHC2017@sobafemi Sir would you tell us how you were able to come out a LEAD despite the LIMITATIONS #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG we'd live with THE END IN MIND 2/2 #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG thirdly, majority of us are NOT VISIONARY AT ALL; we live for TODAY &amp; not for our FUTURE. If we knew, we'd live 1/2 #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG another limitation is 2. PEER PRESSURE/COMPARISON... we live by what other people do &amp; that alone is MISLEADING #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG the limitations I have experienced include:
1. History: people have gone through a lot of pains &amp; breaking points #LHC2017@sobafemi Sir please share with us as a BEHAVIOURAL Coach. What are the limitations to TAKING THE LEAD #LHC2017The ability to learn from everything around us is what make us trained. #LHC2017 https://t.co/WlLBLbCpTs@LoftyHeightsNG see, people who DO NOT LEAD are people who FOCUS on TEMPORAL ATTRIBUTES than the ETERNAL/SUBCONSCIOUS #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG an UNTRAINED person is one who believes that CREDENTIALS &amp; ACCOLADES are SUPERIOR to SOCIAL LEARNING #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG we mistake EDUCATION &amp; SCHOOLING.

The Trained is a person who LEARNS FROM EVERYTHING #CONSCIOUSLY #LHC2017@sobafemi sir, sorry to cut in. What makes one Trained and another Untrained? Because that was deep.  #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG this is why even the UNTRAINED seems BOLD &amp; the TRAINED is TIMID. Training can rob us of our CONFIDENCE #LHC2017@LoftyHeightsNG apparently, many of us are AFRAID to put our BEST FOOT FORWARD. We wait for ENDORSEMENTS or APPROVALS #LHC2017 @sobcacademy@LoftyHeightsNG I see #TakeTheLead as a call. It is always not late to REMIND our people that we ARE called to LEAD #LHC2017 @sobcacademy@LoftyHeightsNG I am Sam Obafemi. I lead a robust team of coaches at @sobcacademy, a regular organization for behavioral change #LHC20171. Good evening friends. I hope the weekend has been gracious so far? Welcome to #LHC2017.
