But he also gives us each other.As we reflect on #GoodFriday, we are reminded of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross that gives us hope and meaning in life.

They were part of the program. We were even told, 'Blessed are they that mourn,' and I accept it. I've got nothing that I hadn't bargained for.

A Grief ObservedBe strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord! Psalm 31:24Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light:
The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the darkness of the land,
Ring in the Christ that is to be.
~ Tennyson
