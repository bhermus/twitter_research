£70 for Arctic Monkeys tickets and people won’t pay £7 to see a local band. Sorry state.Dear world, the people of the UK do not want to bomb Syria. Our country is living off Food Banks, we have massive poverty levels  @theresa_may keeps cutting money and helping the rich. We can't afford to live, yet our PM can fund a war. We are sorry and ashamed.

#SyriaStrikesWe're proud to announce  @PompadourBand @BigSmileRevival @youdirtyblue @airmilesband live at @TheMothersRuin on Friday April 6th.  Tickets available direct from the bands.
