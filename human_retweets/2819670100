I own an AR-15. I've used it for target shooting maybe 3 times in the past decade. Honestly I don't need it and could easily live without it. I'd happily give mine up if it meant I'd never see innocent people get gunned down by one again.Parkland, Florida, teacher on CNN who had to hide 19 crying kids in a closet in her classroom: “We did everything we were trained to do in active shooter drills, and still we had mass casualties.
