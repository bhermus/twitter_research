Any leader walking on red carpets at this mourning &amp; disheartening period should know they are walking on the blood of the innocent that passed on through attacks on various parts of the country. 

My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to the victims &amp; families affected #PrayForBenue üôèüèΩ https://t.co/60wZb2EMZyWho will save the people of Benue , Nasarawa and all the poor ruler people, Mostly farmers from this Terrosist Herdsmen, We have a President that have no clue and a National Assembly that doesn't know their work. #ResignPMB if you can't do your job  #PrayForBenue cc: @segalink qHerdmen Menace getting worse like Boko Haram gradually.
Help our nation oh lord. 
#PrayforBenueWe are being killed
We are left homeless 
Our homes are now slaughterhouses 
Our streets filled with blood and bodies
 #StopTheKillings
#PrayForBenueIt is worrying how we take news of bloodshed as just another episode of our everyday life. The quest for peaceful coexistence should be relentless. Perpetrators of crime must be brought to justice. We are duty bound to seek justice for the dead. #PrayForBenueAfter #BBNaija Big Brother ends on Sunday, one of the housemates should be checked into a very good psychiatric home in South Africa for the next one year. If you know who, then I am right and you agree. If you don't know who, it means you should be the one to be checked in.We don‚Äôt want the pairs  #BBNaijaGiving birth is the second most painful thing a human can experience. God bless every woman! Much respectSave the date. the 3rd Isolo Shopping Festival is almost here. cc @myisfofficial #wegoingallout #myisf #shopping #festival #isolo #fashion #gadgets https://t.co/cNqz2asvcLAs #BenueMourns , our heartfelt prayers and thoughts are with the people of the state.

We must also join our voices to the demand that government at all levels (especially the Federal Government) be more proactive in ending these unjust killings &amp; also punish the perpetrators. https://t.co/uNimHRUCUaYou gotta become so great that they cant deny you without hurting themselvesIf life is like this for those privileged by education and provision, then this Xmas, spare a thought for those Nigerians truly living in poverty.The most baffling thing is nobody seems to have a clue what has to be done to change things. Not even a hope of: 'In 2019, let's vote for so and so'. After all, we tried that in 2015, no change. 

It's like Nigerians have been sentenced to life imprisonment in their own country.You see a young man drinking beer and eating grilled fish and still looking frustrated with life and everything else. I don't know if this is a special characteristic for Lagosians or if it's the Nigerian condition.‚ÄúEverything in Nigeria is going to kill you‚Äù - @ayosogunro https://t.co/F87TSuQuXiEverything in Nigeria is going to kill you - Ayo Sogunro, 2014 https://t.co/sGak7mXAlfWe couldn't find fuel last night &amp; no light.

/End.I've spent just over a week in Lagos and I'm shocked to discover that Nigeria's middle class is crying in pain. Nobody I've met so far is having life easy. People are actually suffering and it's not just about money.No matter how tough things get, there will always be a way out for you. You are going forward and upward. Have an awesome week.The sustainable solution is for Nigeria to become the kind of environment they seek in Europe. This is not impossible at all. Europe did not drop from heaven. #NigeriaMustDevelop#RedeemersUniversity PLEASE live up to your name. Be an example of a truly Christ-like Uni. Don't Condemn.
