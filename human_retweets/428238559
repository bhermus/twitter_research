the almond milk was unrefrigerated and we had no ice. and I needed cereal 911 bad https://t.co/rrSIPnhIwgmixing cereals together is sacrilegious. 

I don’t trust people that do that.I feel like this ice pack in my cereal is gonna give me mercury poisoning or something.I’m not nervous your nervous. 

I’m irritated you think I’m nervous. https://t.co/1Iu7OkHpS8All joking aside I actually did just get super sketched out when I finished my cereal and found these strange things in the bottom of my bowl....

However upon further investigation I realized they are the cookies from my Cookie Crisp that I had on pour number 3.

Anyone who knows her knows how hard she works and how selfless, loving &amp; positive she truly is. If you don't like eureka, then you obv don't know her. 🤷🏼‍♀️today, i fell in love again.. like i said i wouldn’t🎶death to the culture of self indulged hipsters.  

May we move towards being an environmentally conscious, progressive, loving and accepting people. A people who work to end racism, empower women with equal rights, and truly love, accept &amp; celebrate our LGBTQ youth.Jut because something isn’t your “thing” doesn’t mean it’s not of worth. That it isn’t art. That it isn’t that persons truth, in fact their most valued and sensitive/vulnerable truth. And then you laugh at it as though it’s a joke? Because you want to look cool. Be a hipster?There is a fine line between criticism that helps an artist grow and being a bully. These are humans with hearts and souls. Success and riches do not equal a healthy mental state of being. Is it ok to bully someone in HS? No. We’ve decided that as a society. This is no different.So who is it next? What artist must you spew your hate on to make yourself feel better? Nickelback? Mumford? Chainsmokers? Bieber? I’m tired of it all. This isn’t a world I want to be a part of. A world of hate.Why is GamoraYoungblood (Saxophone edition) who's gonna tell 5SOS this guy ended their career??? 🤔 https://t.co/jLUVPZSn8rI may not tweet a lot anymore but ANIMAL CROSSING TEA SETS EXIST😭😭 https://t.co/BiosuK675rAnd furthermore it must be said:
Your words have lead to mental health issues in the music industry. Whether it was Chester &amp; Avicii demonized by the press and even some of their fans. Vitoral words of hate and hipster judgement. Not honest criticism, which is entirely different.those who have such little self worth that they feel a need to demean others art. Who are you? The ultimate judge of authenticity and cool? Did you create art and have the ultimate say on something so sacred and individualized? No. It is not yours to judge.and to all the people who spend a lifetime thinking it’s cool to spew disgusting hate &amp; bullying words at artists who are trying to live their truth. Shame on you. I’m disgusted to see years of people sitting on high towers criticizing artists for being “commercial &amp; successful”I am undefined.
