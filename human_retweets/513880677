Jim Clapper served his country for over a half century, including in Vietnam. You did not. By your words &amp; behavior, you diminish the Office of the Presidency. https://t.co/bYlmZInDoM@serialsmite @Amadeus_A_  https://t.co/wlKm7ao91Mhttps://t.co/nGkS59Sh8uhttps://t.co/uTt7AkoJlAUsually don't care what DM has to say but @Wowy_Smite is too nice. What DM says in this clip is so incredibly unfounded, it's weird. It's like he tried to make something up to sound like he knows the inside workings of teams. Wowy is 100% SPL caliber. https://t.co/mlfCYojRJMAs someone that had teamed with Wowy for months and listened to his comms for months - DM is 100% incorrect. His comms were rough at the start, but he spent ages working on them and bow talks more than most ADCs that I've worked with. https://t.co/11tkHiXI2Zcrush: so what special talents do you have?
