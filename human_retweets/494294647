A recent Windows Update turned on Windows Ink. This might cause problems with your canvas, specifically Photoshop. Uncheck this!

PLEASE RETWEET 4 others who might be having problems after this update https://t.co/0k87D75guni see no difference https://t.co/IQhNuv18m8I could go the whole month without hearing

- negative comments
- political news
- subtweets
- drama

and I'd still be ok.social anxiety is not

“omggg I love netflix and I hate everyone”

it’s

- longing to go to social situations that are easy for other people
- wanting to use your voice, but feeling stifled
- feeling trapped in your thoughts

and so much moreSmall victories. https://t.co/9tujfWroc9🌊VAPEWILD SUPER SATURDAY🌊
