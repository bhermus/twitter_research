#MasterchefAU #BakeoffAUChris and Kristie return for the new series of #MasterchefAU - and they talk Nonna's galore, discuss amazing filo pastry, and review night one of the Masterchef Australia drinking game. A great listen. https://t.co/MJyjCRUV7RHERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAAYYYYY https://t.co/yeDhtWetzzIf you watch Godzilla backwards its about a dinosaur who passionately pieces a city back together before moonwalking into the sea.All too easy to fall into the traps set by those who want football rivalry to go way beyond what it‚Äôs meant to be about - a game - and into something toxic and spiteful. We all have more in common than we realise. I wish Fergie a good and speedy recovery. https://t.co/j1UkfCtTZWStaggering statement from FFA on a ‚Äòtechnical failure‚Äô in the VAR system. It‚Äôs tainted a grand final. Unbelievable #aleague https://t.co/Z5fXqu6297I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or to cry... Just not good enough for this to happen - let alone during the biggest game of the @ALeague season. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #ineedtoliedown https://t.co/Oev3nh1V8BLudicrous #ALeagueGF https://t.co/Zbqow2NaHVWOW. FFA says a technical issue caused an issue with the VAR last night and that the VAR did not have access to all camera views.156 years ago today, three brave Americans defeated El Guapo at the Battle of Santa Poco to give Mexico its independence.
#CincoDeMayo https://t.co/WUPsfUTFCOThe final, game-winning goal was set up by an offside player and VAR didn't overrule it.

This was the end this season deserved #ALeagueGF@FFA Well done on fucking up the Grand Final@ALeague @gomvfc @FOXFOOTBALL What‚Äôs the point of VAR if it can‚Äôt call an offside goal in a Grand Final? #ALeagueGF #NEWvMVCAnti-football wins. #ALeagueGFHope FIFA and the AFC are enjoying this match tonight, in a team in 4th might win the "championship" through a clearly offside goal.

Jets have been absolutely robbed. #ALeagueGFHoly moly imagine if the A-League Grand Final was decided by an offside goal the VAR failed to intervene on.

We don't deserve this league #ALeagueGFlove it https://t.co/vu3QjyHCeCGET IN!! üí™

Horrible to think about really.Derek Hales with possibly the most miserable player profile in football history, in a #cafc programme from 1979.

Because guys who think like this are violent to their girlfriends. 

It's not their singleness that's dangerous; it's the way they think about women.Ya baby!!!!!! @LogancoutureYes, kid, this is okay. In fact, it‚Äôs more than okay. You‚Äôre a genuine goddamn superhero. https://t.co/s9w9v05qcWCouture wins it for SJI really can't believe the NHL wouldn't allow a mascot to a very serious event in which a series of lottery balls determines the order of logos being placed on oversized cardboard squares.Apparently I've turned the lottery from the Taylor Hall show into the Monty Hall problem.So math folks, based on knowing those three teams, can we figure out the odds that each of them won? Like, it's not 33/33/33, right? Would it be BUF 59%, MTL 31%, CAR 10%?BREAKING: Bergevin thinks his lottery pick has character issues.My favorite thing on Twitter rn is the icarly Brazil account that responds to every single one of Kanye‚Äôs tweets https://t.co/PRYlAZVAcyJOKE. https://t.co/8vMR9UafQEArnie | "I couldn't be prouder of the 4 seasons we've had at Sydney. We've created history and it's been an honour to coach these players." #SydneyIsSkyBlue #BigBlue #ALeagueFinalsSlight suspicion of handball against Erik Pieters there.
By 'slight suspicion' we mean absolutely blatant.Arnie | "I've told the boys no one can take away what we've done the last two years." #SydneyIsSkyBlue #BigBlue #ALeagueFinalsHow has a penalty not been given there? https://t.co/wy5HSrHPMRYOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT. ARGHHHHHHHHHH. IF HE DOESN'T HANDBALL IT LIVERPOOL SCORE.Minutes remain for Alberto Moreno to do something silly and get himself trending on Twitter again.We gave it our all, we tried to win, but Muscat‚Äôs anti-football approach worked. Bad way to end the season, but we won the league. This post season cup thing is cute though. Carn Jets!!!Can somebody explain to me why at a @SydneyFC home semi-final, there‚Äôs a message saying, ‚Äú#MVFC Thank you to the best fans in the league‚Äù? I mean, is this a joke? What serious league would do that to the home team? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #SYDvMVC #BigBlue #ALeague https://t.co/p8V0qxdnaWI‚Äôm heartbroken for my Sky Blues, but I am so proud of what we‚Äôve achieved this year. Thank you Arnie, you helped turn @SydneyFC into the giant it has always proclaimed to be. And if it is the end, thank you Brosquey. #SydneyIsSkyBlue #TwoOutOfThreeAintBad https://t.co/bDosBt5TL7Great credit to Victory ad Terry Antonis. Could have dropped their heads after the equaliser. But showed tremendous heart and courage. Deserved it in the end. Sad way to end season for Sydney, who have been far and away the best team in the League.If the choices were cheer for Melbourne Victory or imminent global annihilation I‚Äôd welcome oblivion.

Go @NewcastleJetsFC #ALeagueGFThis is what‚Äôs so shit about football. We‚Äôve been the best team all season, but won‚Äôt make the GF due to one game, yet a team that‚Äôs had a very up &amp; down season has made it.

Sigh.

 #SYDvMVC #bigblue #ALeagueFinalsHT: 0-0. Liverpool haven't created much, but have managed to keep Stoke and Alberto Moreno relatively quiet.Lawrence Thomas is playing well against @SydneyFC. Against @gomvfc, not so well #SYDvMVC90+5' GOALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!! WHAT JUST HAPPENED!!!!!!! Some sustained pressure ends with @adrianmierzej86 crossing back into the area and seeing his effort deflected in by Antonis! 2-2 #SydneyIsSkyBlue #BigBlue #ALeagueFinals #NotDoneYetWho knew there was an action figure of the most pissweak Batman villain? Thanks for this, Gotham's own @LachyHulme. https://t.co/kUxd7Dd9ihLoving #DirtyComputer another brilliant album @JanelleMonae .

Mike McGlinchey?Barkley at the Combine was stronger than Joe Thomas, quicker than DeSean Jackson, faster than Devin Hester, and jumped higher than Julio Jones.

He‚Äôs amazing and even better off the field. Checks every box.PARKLIFE https://t.co/msN4rJKYeKI would like to say the Browns taking Mayfield is a big win for analytics but I think it‚Äôs more accurate to say the Browns not taking Josh Allen is a big win for analytics.Colbert on Macron‚Äôs prediction that the U.S. will return to the Paris agreement:

Not to gloat or gawk ‚Äî to ask him the questions that @TrueCrimeDiary wanted answered in her ‚ÄúLetter To An Old Man‚Äù at the end of #IllBeGoneInTheDark. https://t.co/32EHSzBct5We live in a magical time https://t.co/WW3ZbCU2nIThe reason why ladders are prohibited this year #eurovision https://t.co/OFrVJrrP1eIt is no accident that #LFC are here, one leg away from a chance at a sixth European Cup, playing with such swagger and making the unreal seem routine at times. J√ºrgen Klopp predicted this revival on the continent - just ask Philippe Coutinho... 

https://t.co/OARurredDK https://t.co/noMIMoH6O2He cost ¬£35 million. üòÇBeing upset about winning 5-2 is the stupidest thing I have ever seen on twitter, and I've seen Michael Flynn Jr's tweets.Big difference between this and the 1-4 at the Camp Nou is that Roma played well against Barca + score should have been closer, which obv gave big psychological boost for return leg.
Not the case tonight. At all.Mo Salah goes with two goals, two assists and 11 Roman souls."Thanks for the baby, Superman!" https://t.co/kgrM9XrvytMitch Mariner just really wanted to delay the game right there.
