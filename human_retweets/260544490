https://t.co/erEX4Ym5hYI think @JUBaseball has played its way into the Top 25 discussion after sweeping a road series against a good Saint Louis club, following a midweek win at Florida. Jacksonville has won 8 straight weekend series, including a big one last week vs FGCU.There might not be a team that did more for their postseason chances this week than Jacksonville. A midweek win over Florida is a marquee result, and a series sweep of Saint Louis has them all the way up to 16 in Warren Nolan's live RPI. https://t.co/4BPnamEW1cLOL Marchand https://t.co/gdcRJesEVBThe defence rests. #OsunaMatata ‚ö°Ô∏è https://t.co/awEC5Ll6AkFINAL | DOLPHINS WIN!
