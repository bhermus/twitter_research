She isn’t afraid to leave anyone behind. She’s authentic &amp; courageous. She’s the type of woman most pray for but get intimidated by because she knows exactly what she wants.

Anything else is just a game.Stay permanently unavailable for anyone who thought you was an option.You get older and outgrow a lot of shit and certain people. Focus on you future, you have shit else to do besides entertaining immaturity and negativity.“I’ll cook for you” ..... nobody want your chicken Alfredo “sis” 💀@ChinaCristine Oh see I wasn’t thinking about that. Only was thinking about wipes and diapers and milk for the month but you right . That’s a sweet lick if you ask me.

God don’t put you through nothing you can’t handleIma start asking bitches who I don’t like for $40 maybe they’ll leave me aloneNEVER ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really LIKE him
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really LIKE him
Cause that's when he’s go make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you go start to feel like you bugging

MANNNN 😫💯💯💯I just feel like... he ain’t man he if can’t provide and if he can’t provide you shouldn’t be fucking w/ him. Bitches be down and out but stay fucking wit multiple dudes. DONT READ TO ME! But that’s just me 🤷‍♀️i’m learning everyday to let go of people who expect me to do &amp; be for them, the very things they aren’t willing to be for me. love shouldn’t be one-sided. i’ve always had a big heart but when it came to the point in my life where protecting my big heart needed to be my priorityI hope me and my man have a relationship like Teyana &amp; Iman😭 they really be hyped over each other , and they relationship is really everything 😍😍😍😍Choose ppl that choose you no matter the circumstances, Mfs be bluffingAt all .! Even the word sorry ain’t enough .. u gotta show me.. https://t.co/HVrdaoor40Careful who you build with.. they’ll structure it to where they can infiltrate it at a moments notice.If you can do it by yourself..
