Trump asked if there were any “Hispanics” in the room and the crowd BOOED. 

He then used YOUR support to justify this naked racism.

THIS is why there was nothing original or edgy about your support of Trump.

All you did was empower racists. https://t.co/dL08s2r6J7Me when I've been arguing with my dad to let me out and he finally says "haz lo que te de la chingada gana" https://t.co/q2QnnbxBt6We're getting closer! ✨ #EDCLV2018 https://t.co/JkKgZbnTL4https://t.co/Xe5PmvbhESI lost it when he said “maruchan” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/jlUCtWHaeM"My boyfriend won't let me-" https://t.co/NTIZTI5OliThe president skipped out on Barbara Bush's services today.
