@CanadiensMTL Funny...throwing shade when you were out of the playoff race since OctoberEat shit, Bruins. Deserved fate after squeaking through Round 1. You got embarrassedBrad Marchand at the post game press conference moments ago https://t.co/XeFQO8HD3eMe when the Bruins fans are mad for not getting a call https://t.co/m3tLrmrnbMLife is so fragile and fleeting... 

Don't waste it being mad, or full of anger.Brad Marchand still has just a single minor penalty in the playoffs. Probably the biggest indictment of the terrible officiating we've been watching.Beautiful White Peacock https://t.co/7WMWiPsvF1Strawberry Sweet Rolls with Vanilla Cream Cheese Glaze. https://t.co/8z3D9UX5WaWhat if the Leafs relieved Lou of his duties because they have their eyes set on acquiring one, if not both, of the super beards from San Jose? Was facial hair the dealbreaker for Jumbo Joe not signing last off season? Did I just blow your mind? https://t.co/oLFcDogCZ7Throwing water on the 15 dumpster organizations who dreamed of signing him for the last hour and a half 💁‍♂️ https://t.co/Sj3Z1q9rJ8Lazy Ass. https://t.co/b1ecBnj0KbThis will forever be the best video on the internet 😂😂 https://t.co/2rgsZgwvk3This is NFL player Desmond Marrow.

1. They're not in our division.

The Bruins did maul us, and left us for dead. But they did not finish the job. We've fought our way back, and now ferociously hunt for our 4th and final bear pelt. As we draw near, I can hear the rat scurrying in panic. Their fear smells as delicious as their chowder

A.MMe, before playoffs: 
"Wow this is great what fun can't wait!"

Me, as soon as the playoffs begin: 
"I am vomiting and my body hurts."Great addition to the @MapleLeafs line-up for tonight's #Game7

 #Unbelievable 
#TMLtalk https://t.co/1LDgWZotCpMy Game 7 prediction 12 hours early: Zach Hyman will be the hero tonight.WARMINGTON: Const. Ken Lam didn't flinch when facing alleged van attacker https://t.co/kB25JlRUED https://t.co/BpkoYdAREHAlso worth remembering how hard Calgary tried to land Andersen. Ducks wanted a bit more from the Flames since they were Pacific Division rivals. Price was deemed too high by Calgary. Leafs got him for low 1st RD pick (Sam Steel) plus a 2nd in '17 ...I think Anaheim wanted to flip first-round picks with the Flames as part of that deal... Cgy had high pick, took Tkachuk, so can't blame Cgy saying No. On the other hand, how much does Andersen in Cgy change things? And what would the Leafs have done if they didn't get Andersen?New post: Five reasons why the Maple Leafs are definitely winning game seven, unless the Bruins do instead. https://t.co/36lxxlBkX5 https://t.co/3qDmN5071EInteresting to look back at summer of 2016 when the Leafs acquired Frederik Andersen from Anaheim. The Ducks deliberated long and hard about which goalie to move. They felt both would have long careers as No. 1 guys. They kept the younger/cheaper option and it's hard to argue 1/2Fuck Brad Marchand

Let's be amazing to each other today. Let's ask each other how we are doing and really listen to the answer. Let's look out for each other and have respect.

And tomorrow let's do that again.Wonder how many people thought Leafs-Bruins would go 7 after the manner in which the Bruins tilted the ice in the opening two games. But here it is. Game 7, Wednesday in Boston. Enjoy, everyone.A little outdated, but I think it's worth the rewatch. https://t.co/og3VDJ3shXThe Real King ❤👑

First he was disrespected by the Ducks. Then by the All Star game. Finally, he was disrespected in Vezina nominations. But in Game 6, the Scandinavian Ginger Save God showed all the experts how wrong they are about him. 

THE BEST IN THE WORLD forces game 7. We live.

A.MTo our city, our people and all those affected by today’s tragic events, our thoughts and prayers are with you.Mother

Our once stagnant spirits are now robust with hope! The arrogant Bostonians have missed their finest chance to eradicate our forces, and now go on the defensive in Fort Toronto. May they grip their sticks as tightly as we shall soon grip their necks. 

A.MFuck the dropkick murphys, fuck Boston , and fuck the Bruins LETS GOOOOOO #budsallfuckindayGreetings everyone. Do report this low life steaming pile of garbage. Thank you, and have a pleasant day. https://t.co/p0E2vvEKuD@DimFilipovic Everyone keeps saying 3rd man in, which is first of all WRONG. Second if that is in fact a third man in, what do you call this play by Marchand in game 4. Way dirtier and went unpenalized. The calls are completely one sided in this series. https://t.co/6ppUEMLf4mSick of hear same old story. We are live in 2018, not 2013.

We crawl to Boston wounded, with an arsenal resembling a rusty spoon. We've been outmatched, outworked, and outwitted. But born in desperate times are moments of glory. We will now take our first step towards redemption. 

A.MThe #Leafs v #Bruins series is not done! Although we need to win 3 straight we take it one at a time! #GoLeafsGo who else thinks the #MapleLeafs can win tonight??? #TML #TMltalk #StandWitness #NHLPlayoffs #NHLPlayoffs2018don't trade your authenticity for approvalpuppy love https://t.co/8nbBNejFPyWhen the puck drops where will you be?

As the Spring sun shines upon Fort Toronto, I sit and polish my golf clubs. Each groove has been cleaned perfectly. But I've not gotten them out to golf, but rather to drive that evasive rat Marchand back to the US. Preferably with a nice draw.

The first battle was embarrassing. We were S̶n̶a̶k̶e̶b̶i̶t̶t̶e̶n̶ Ratbitten. Our next mission will likely be without PTE Kadri, as he literally made PTE WIngels kiss his ass at 75 mph. They will pay for this.
