Dear Detroit,
Sorry about taking Kennard over Mitchell, overpaying Reggie Jackson, taking Stanley Johnson over getting four 1sts from Boston, ruining your salary cap with the Blake trade, and leaving you without a 2018 1st. I’m gonna go do TV, I’ll see you later.

Lol. https://t.co/uo4er7X6TVWhen you been sending her mixed signals and dodging commitment for months and she decides to find a new man https://t.co/whE93Qt26bwinning a second round series &gt;&gt;&gt; winning 5 championships and making the playoffs every year since i was a toddler https://t.co/Yita8ljapnYo somebody get they mans https://t.co/7ie4WUptLkI understand and accept that WWE believes Roman Reigns is a megastar. He’s incredibly talented, so I get it. But the audience cannot stand him. Period. You cannot keep ignoring this. Putting out main event matches the crowd despises is not good business. #WWEBacklashDid we make Backlash a four hour PPV? 
We must have been on drugs at the time.
#WWEBacklashOur main event is between two guys who lost at @WrestleMania #WWEBacklashWarriors fans wanted Curry's redemption. KD undercut that narrative. They'll win forever, but the story sucks, so now they're hilariously defensive about anything to do with KD's arrivalDonovan Mitchell shooting 25% since taking Kobe’s advice. 🤢🤢🤢Chris Paul tired of the 3rd round jokey jokes.Not putting @AJStylesOrg vs. @ShinsukeN in the main event is a real shot to the nuts #WWEBacklashThat's right folks, the WWE Title isn't going to main event Backlash. 
Time for @VinceMcMahon to feed on your hate and anger.
#WWEBacklashY’all graduation captions be killing me with the inspiration. Mfs be like “i was murdered on my 12th birthday and survived a nuclear explosion now I have a 6.0 and I’m finna be a doctor”Happy #RusevDay Backlash ! Bob Roode twerking like a skunk was terrible“Son, gimme kiss before you go to school” https://t.co/GZH6S1HomjTOR had a 38 point 4th quarter. Imagine hanging 38 in a 4th quarter on a road playoff game just to take an L from a shot that everyone reading this has thrown up while just fucking around as we're leaving the gymIf Igor taught Ayton how to become more instinctual on defense like Gobert in Utah, he could quickly become a terrifying rim protector. https://t.co/d6DyeB1k2kWhen you finally understand why KD had to join a 73-9 team. https://t.co/XO0IIbKOJrre: lebron. problem was you dorks were missing that just about all those passes were the right move and not out of being afraid.

and you ignored all those big shots in 2012 that he hit late, only for the other team to hit a game winner after.

it was mostly a stupid discussion. https://t.co/2sMoDHv0b4Aspirations https://t.co/8Xx8OgdqG8LeBron can beat any team in this league in the playoffs besides Golden State. and if LeBron wins a title this year with this team then Jordan gotta go to Cleveland and hand LeBron an actual real life goat.@TylerIAm when you hit bae between the numbers and she takes it to the house for 50 yards 😍😍😍.. https://t.co/l4VAZog9bd@World_Wide_Wob  https://t.co/860B8h8xweLebron Game Winner got this nigga so mad he bringing up Health Care in NBA debates.

LeBron went next level with the bullying.Oh my God LeBron - looks like I’m gonna have to re-do the Pyramid this summer.Don't talk to me. Don't look at me. Don't even fuckin read this tweet.As someone who has always said to wait until Stevens was actually great in a playoff series, he’s been a coaching cheat code in the playoffs. He’s been just amazing I’m so many ways. This is a series he should lose on talent and he’s helped them dominate.Really was looking forward to Bron deciding to play defense for the 6th time this season and making Simmons work in the ECF but now I don't know manthe celtics bench is trying so hard not to celebrate 😂😂😂 https://t.co/GKYbk9DDgeBodiid him https://t.co/lH1l4kwbhsI like Reggie, personally and professionally. But if it weren't for Mack-Carr-Jackson in 2014, his draft history would look pretty bad. https://t.co/pVfoKxdYoWHer kids https://t.co/08Nmtrum8Noh, today's the fifth of may.
