1) Fuel Scarcity - No actual scarcity
2) Boko Haram - Technically defeated
3) Recession - Just a wordThis is the 3rd fuel scarcity under Buhari in 2 1/2 years. First one was in Sept-December 2015. For 3 months Nigeria suffered but PMB didn't blink. Second one was in April/May 2016 which he cunningly increased fuel from N87 - N145 and now December 2017.
