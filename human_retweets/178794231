The 3 people in charge of the Special Counsel investigation are:

-Deputy AG Rosenstein, a Republican

This is about outing gay kids.

The Alberta Party.Updated list of groups attacked at #UCPagm: 

1. Feminists
2. #LGBTQ2 persons 
3. Teachers 
4. The #ATA

7. “Socialists” (ie: anyone who isn’t a conservative) 

Am I missing anyone? 

#ableg #cdnpoli#LGBTQ teens are at higher risk for mental health issues &amp; suicide.
57% of #UCPAGM delegates want to make it harder for them to find support &amp; acceptance.

#yegastro #yegwxI dont understand. The NRA has banned guns at their convention because Pence will be there. But guns don't kill people, people kill people. I know that because the NRA says so. They should be banning the people, and leaving cheering guns in the the seats of the auditorium.A white guy with an AR-15 killed 4 blacks at a Waffle House. Trump never said a word about it. And the media let him slide.

A comedian told some jokes at a dinner, and the media are outraged.Imagine endorsing Roy Moore and then getting offended by jokes.Donald Trump:
— “Grab em by the pussy”
— “I moved on her like a bitch”
— “Blood coming out of her wherever”
— “I would bomb the shit out of them”
— “If she wasn’t my daughter I’d date her”
— “African countries are shithole nations”

Republicans:
— “Michelle Wolf was over the top”The thing that I find odd about @FaithGoldy is that she is so against immigrants that can't 'assimilate' while her own ancestors (Greek and Ukrainian) were punished and marginalized under the same logic.

#ableg https://t.co/mU2EvV3SMl1. Donald Trump won the GOP primary and the presidency because campaigning on whiteness-first messaging still has potency in the 21st century.

If you want to support UCP but also call yourself an LGTBQ2 ally, I'm here to tell you that you can't be both.

Any group or organization that refuses to respect the Charter of Rights and Freedoms should not get government funding to take away the Charter rights of other groups. Capiche?

#cdnpoliThe entire Republican Party operationalized against the Dixie Chicks when they spoke against Bush and the Iraq War. 

Suddenly, the GOP wants to cry “censorship” because advertisers in the free market don’t want to pay Laura Ingraham to bully a teenage mass shooting survivor.No problem seeing #ISS, but no sign of @SpaceX Dragon tonight. Better chance tomorrow (best pass centred on 21:26 MDT) when it will be 24 hours closer to rendezvous &amp; certain to be relatively close to ISS, at most a few seconds ahead or behind. (Remember, 1 second = 7 km!)Which means every denial was a lie. https://t.co/sdxhMAeTdfI watched the first black president be burned in effigy and lynching jokes go viral while Donald Trump built a political career on a racist lie.

So I really don't wanna hear how we're being mean to the first orange president on Twitter. Go find a safe space, snowflakes.

She was just sentenced to 5 years in prison, not because she murdered someone or kidnapped someone.

Crystal was sentenced to 5 years after she voted in the 2016 election while she was on probation.

Crystal was never told that she was not allowed to vote
