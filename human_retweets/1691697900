There will be empty spots in our prom pictures tmrw. 

There will be space on the dancefloor for those we lost this year. 

Tmrw, let us celebrate their lives, and enjoy our #prom for them too.Once my ex was giving me head and - I kid u not - he literally BIT my clitoris. Like, intentionally just chomped down on my goddamn clit. So I pushed him off and said WHAT THE HELL and he was like “wait did u not like that??” and that was the day I gave up on sex with hetero menYou got "having baby" money? https://t.co/vxx6P02DErIf your friend is a singer/rapper BUY THEIR ALBUM

(Trump seconds later): "…they will never, ever be under siege as long as I am president."

Is he saying he’s no longer president??I am a burden

*message sent with confetti*it’s strange to be sad and also the happiest ever, all at once 🤔Trump said, "Our hearts break for every American who has suffered the horrors of this school shooting.” Surprising since I’ve never heard from him, Pence, or his staff since Carmen’s murder. Received heartfelt outpouring from thousands of other Americans. They make America strong"You hit me like a headrush, and hurt like a paper cut.
And you're still in my head but just not in my heart."

5. Independence.
6. Painting our faces.
7. How many people we’ve slept with.
8. Looking like hell.
9. Making more money.
10. Eating too much.Classes That SHOULD Be Mandatory in High School:

- Accounting
- Money Management
- Taxes
- How to Build and Keep Good Credit
- Establishing a Job/Career
- Nutrition

☑ watching HIMYMConservatives: "If it hasn't happened to me, I don't care."

Liberals: "This should never happen to anyone, and that's why I care."Don’t say the name of the gunman. Refer to him as his prison ID “18-19-58” or “the killer”, but don’t say his name. It’s painful to hear and we shouldn’t be focusing on him because he doesn’t matter. Instead, learn about the 17 beautiful people we lost. Know their names, not his.This was deep. #HIMYM https://t.co/XTRDIxsIa3If you speak up about abuse immediately: you're looking for attention.

I will never forget the fear one cop had in his eyes when he told us to run. I will never forget them trying to block the dead bodies so we wouldn’t have to see it. I will never forget.Our lack of gun control legislation is not the only thing that contributed to my school's shooting. Although it seemed unlikely/unpredictable, the FBI and BCPS should have taken the shooter's warning signs seriously. It shouldn't have taken 17 deaths to realize that.It doesn’t get any better, mama 😭 https://t.co/3LWpdsYwDfDo you like how it feels

I see a pattern, do you? #banassaultrifles https://t.co/YGNyuCtKj9It’s entertaining being informed about what happened at MY high school shooting or about the people that I go to school with. It’s almost as if I wasn’t in the building when everything happened and I haven’t been attending MSD for four years. But go off Susie from AlaskaIf I was a prof, I would put a 5 point question at the end of all my exams and say “write down any information that you studied your butt off to know and I didn’t ask you about” because NOTHING is more frustrating than not being asked what you were told you would need to knowI made meatloaf, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and green beans for dinner and I feel like a real ass housewife.I guess yesterday was national husband appreciation day &amp; I had no idea until just now.

Now he’s what’s for dinner. He’s become the meatloaf. 🍽James Shaw Jr. rushed the Waffle House shooter, disarmed him and threw the AR-15 assault rifle he was carrying over the counter.
