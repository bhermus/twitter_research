I can’t go back and forth on twitter.
The internet is too quick to pounce at anything that makes them uncomfortable with all caps not really listening to anything but more like pushing their point of view to make them seem rightDon't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.everyone should be their own biggest fanThis is James Shaw.
