So in one of my Management classes I sit in the same seat in the front every day. Every single day I sit there. 

Now, I also sit next to some foreign guy thatLas Vegas is a real community with real locals and real families who live real lives far from the bright lights of The Strip. Many people who don't live here don't know that or just ignore it. That will change during this #VegasBorn run in the #StanleyCup https://t.co/81NncLwgkCRoses are red,

One of my proudest moments in life was take the World's Expert in Gravity into Zero Gravity. @GoZeroG https://t.co/xlU62ddvIEHey, kids‚Äîthe House and Senate aren‚Äôt going to do anything about guns. Neither is the president, a morally vacant boob who will say anything. We have to do it ourselves. Get as many NRA sweethearts as possible out in November. We can do this.Since Parkland shooting:

A gun was fired unintentionally at a K-12 school in Florida

A Georgia teacher fired a gun inside class

An Ohio 7th grader brought a semiautomatic rifle to school. He planned a mass shooting but killed himself instead

Now Central Michigan University@JaclynCorin @Emma4Change Funny how no one dismisses Malala Yousafzai as "just some teen". Apparently teenage activism is fine as long as it doesn't hurt gun manufacturers' bottom line.Retweet if you are angry and done with the status quo. Retweet if you are done with nonsense bandaid fixes. Retweet if you believe that arming our children‚Äôs educators is absolutely insane.Thanks to the bravery of the Parkland shooting survivors, @NRA-sponsored politicians are finally being seen as toxic. As Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg put it on CNN, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt get elected without taking money from child murderers, why are you running?‚ÄùThe only thing more stunning than the scale of Russian interference uncovered today is the fact that an American President is taking no action to protect our country against an ongoing threat. This is a dereliction of duty.This is my grandpa. When he was 12 years old, he hid in a closet while his family was murdered during the first mass shooting in America. Almost 70 years later, I also hid in a closet from a murderer. These events shouldn't be repetitive. Something has to change. #douglasstrong https://t.co/nDctTNlUNsJimmy talks to the @Eagles' @ZERTZ_86 about his #SuperBowl-winning touchdown. https://t.co/bhCuYnvbjZIt‚Äôs finally here!
