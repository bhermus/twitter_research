EVERY @dallascowboys TD from @TonyRomo to @JasonWitten! https://t.co/8dv4KZJz4p@Raptors They turned the 0-2 into the 0-3 dawgJason Witten Goat 🐐 respectUnderrated Jason Witten moment: when Romo hit him on a must-have 4th down during the go-ahead drive in the wildcard win against Detroit.

Of course, he ran the most Jason Witten route there is. https://t.co/hxFdabFG8gLet’s get this rolling!! Couldn’t be more excited and thankful to be a Dallas Cowboy, it’s only the beginning and such a blessing to finally live out my dream and be part of the best organization in the country!

See ya in 8 months for a brand new season. #CowboysNationTom Brady to Josh McDaniels “Its f**king cold bro” 😂😂 https://t.co/fK6XRphNFeI left it all out there, gave this team and this city everything I had. I will always cherish these days. I love you Cane family!!!I remember tht play bro it was the greatest NCAA interception I have ever seen. I also remember I’m 3-0 vs @FSUFootball including in 87 we were down 19-3 I had a 35 &amp; 73yrd TD late 2 come fr behind &amp; win the game &amp; tht yr the bling thing call a ring 💍that’s dust leaving bro 😂😂 https://t.co/e37cmfkQiuBenny Snell was just ejected from the game for this. Refusing a refs help up?!? Never seen anything like it https://t.co/MX1rMaOglJyou, an Ohioan: Buckeyes dominated, told you they got screwed out of the playoffs.

me, a logical person: the combined total of this game is 24 points fewer than Iowa scored on these dudes.@therealTChoate @dallascowboys We deserve it. They’ve won 2 playoff games in our lifetime, but for some dumb reason I always think they will turn it around. Anyways, next year man, that’s our year. #CowboysFamEarl Thomas on visiting Cowboys locker room after game: When the Seahawks kick me to the curb, please, Cowboys, come get me https://t.co/gqp0eb2VFoDak Prescott 4th pick-six this season, most in the NFLI'm not convinced it's a good idea for the Cowboys to throw two consecutive passes at any point for the rest of this game, but I'm sure they will.2017 Army Football:
