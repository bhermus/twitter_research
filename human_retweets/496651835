I want it!!!!Love is the only thing in this world that does not hurt.Everyone says love hurts, but that is not true. Loneliness hurts. Rejection hurts. Losing someone hurts. Envy hurts. Everyone gets these things confused with love, but in reality love is the only thing in this world that covers up all pain and makes someone feel wonderful again-my only relationship goal is to be with someone who makes me happy and will do anything to keep it that wayBelieve in yourself and never stop. Everything will fall into place 🙏🏼🙏🏼✨✨I should slap your disrespectful ass https://t.co/Bp5n5AotIIFT&gt;textingI wish I could live close to the beachI just wanted to do some tonight ☹️☹️☹️ I guess I’m staying in 💔RT if you from the Dirty 830
