Based on these metrics, Slepyshev looks like a strong bottom-6 forward with top-6 versatility. By the way, where did you get 17/18 from @PuckIQ? I can only find 16/17. https://t.co/lbKEbSDa5bWhen is the @JimmyKimmel monologue on Alfie Evans?Ashton Kutcher is really THAT guy. I had no idea he stopped his acting career to fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children. https://t.co/siMsfoL0uqDespite our massive amount of oil, Canada is facing the highest gas prices in a decade.

I think they're trying to finalize a deal. I'm not reporting that it's done, but I'm suggesting that I wouldn't be surprised if they get it done." #Canes 1050One thing that cannot be argued:

The majority of the NHL's top-scoring forwards were drafted either first or second overall. 

The overwhelming majority of the NHL's best defensemen were drafted well after the lottery.@SuperNovs1 JP is still a prospect and will, presumably, be given a shot. But how often was Slepyshev shunted to the side so Caggiula or Lucic could take the minutes?Stanton bounces into a double play. Some boos at Yankee Stadium.Last Spring there seemed to be "Diplomatic Immunity" for the likes of Ryan Getzlaf, Ryan Kesler and Corey Perry in the Oilers/Ducks series...

A: "We haven't looked at that too closely yet"?

THIS IS YOUR JOB. Jeezus...fans had done that analysis themselves months ago.Condors lose 2-1.

Strong debut from Cooper Marody. He was on a line Dave Gust and Tyler Vesel. The trio were the Condors most dangerous unit. 

After those three the major positive, once again, was Dmitri Samorukov. His skill level and mobility was impressive tonight. https://t.co/QQAw9ygGPW
