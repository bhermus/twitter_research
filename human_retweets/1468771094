Curious hearts..untamed souls

Crossing the line of uncertainty 

With no intention of turning back 

From moonlight to sunrise our bodies connect 

Unlocking the mysteries of our emotions..... https://t.co/RMGQ2aXjeqSadness seeped into Jim‚Äôs bones. His soul wounded. Poisoned by grief. He still couldn‚Äôt believe she‚Äôd gone. The house empty. Her everyday sounds, the backdrop to his existence dissipated. He started each day with a #glass of whisky. Knew he wasn‚Äôt far behind her.  #vss365 https://t.co/1SilnHL4T6I‚Äôm sorry you found a mess under the woman you fell in love withyou can flip to the end of the book and say you‚Äôve finished
but you‚Äôd be missing the storyI have too many feelings and endless thoughts to have no one to share them with.for a limited time only 
*everything*Absent are the fatal kisses
Attempting to clear the frost
Of winter
From the fires seen
Through the window of
Our yesteryear 
With the poisons spoken
Tween our lips
 #SenseWrds 395I was the girl
who never had a voice
I am the woman
finding itIn the quiet hours
of a lonely soul
A brilliant 
brave moon shines
Gilded whispers
failed to be
The dreams
she thought
would set
her Free.

#inkMine https://t.co/2dYLVnxvX9It is best to love wisely, no doubt; but to love foolishly is better than not to be able to love at all.
William Makepeace Thackeray https://t.co/q9UipRG9sRSo much courage is needed to stay soft, to stay vulnerable, to stay open, to allow love to enter the heart again and to dream of laughter, of new life with you.How many times can you tell your life story? The times you twisted when you should have turned, sifting rubbish that should be burned, turning back before you forget what you learned.

You will see

Her body was intoxicating. 
But her mind...
her mind was what kept him 
coming back for more."

#LadyEPoetry https://t.co/MXGV6QklPEHe spent the end of his life
Counting down the days
Tiny marks in a calendar
Some days there were notes
One or two words only
'children playing'
'butterflies!'
'no pain'
I wept as I read through
A simple life in notations
#VerseAngel 166Just tried typing the word alone and it was autocorrected to the word alive and now I have a different view on life.My explanation
I fell hard
and I've no answers
how to get back up
It's not so bad down here
just tidy up
dust the cobwebs away
replace the curtains
of my soul
Open the fucking window
let a little fresh air
and light in
write a book
dictate how it ends
I want a purple sunsetBurning dreams rip silent flames
through my wildfire seared soul.
Brand me with your kiss.

üé∂Sadness fell in love with depressionWhat an idiot.  https://t.co/INtdBbLM95Some people are crazy in a beautiful kind of way.Hold my hand, and promise me that you'll never let me go.And then all of a sudden
She changed.
She came back a completely different person with a new mindset,
a new soul, a new outlook.
A girl that once was a hurricane 
Has become so soft like a work of art...If you fall apart, write it down, write until the pain subsides for a while.It broke me to say goodbye
It killed my heart to part
It was under the words
Under the pain
Under the strength that I had to hold
That my being was glowing
Beneath the spoken story
Because I never stopped loving you

#WrittenRiverLife is like a poem. Sometimes you don't know where or how or when to end it.Easy? Hell no.
Worth it? AbsofuckinglutelyI only have two modes:
Obsess over it
Forget about itIf you want her..

You make damn sure she knows it
Don't get mad when she assumes you don't.Good morning, you delightful bunch of diverse examples of human beings.

Have a super duper day and don't forget to be as awesome as you possibly can.Her love 
A gift  
She willingly 
Gives you 
It's not easy 
For her 
To trust 
Just anyone 
With her heart 
For she's been hurt 
But 
You're the one 
She's waited for 
Her whole life for 
The one 
She calls home 

#FSMPYI like
rainy days
beautiful words
ethnic instrumental music
deep conversations
old cemeteries
December sunsets
untamed forest
medieval ruins
bookstores
the sea
museums
Sundays
storms
rivers
midnight
‚Ä¶and everything
that makes your soul acheNot everybody will make the cut. Some call that mean and some call It life

I call it lifeSome memories you‚Äôll always appreciatePeople that don‚Äôt make time for you need to learn that your time is not infinite.wherever you wander, look for me there.Under the light
Of the sorrowful moon
She carried her weary  bones
to the ancient oak
Turned a few times
As Crones do
And whispered 
a whimpered goodbye
In hushed tones of ancient rhymeWhat he does to her in seconds, other men couldn‚Äôt do in a lifetime.What have I become, my sweetest friend. Everyone I know goes away in the end.  
Johnny Cash - Hurt https://t.co/oMZWtAzpjcThey laugh at me because I‚Äôm different. I laugh at them because they are all the same. https://t.co/81KM5tEgSRThe world breaks everyone, and afterwards, some are strong at the broken places. 
Ernest Hemingway https://t.co/O4QwxIcvZCIf I don't sleep, you don't sleep.

That's how this works...to capture a poet's heart..is to catch a hurricane..within a netted kiss..that tiny moment when you feel kind and humble. the moment when your body sighs and eyes feel soft, when your entire being is thankful and forgiving. that single moment is when you have truly lived.her eyes come with a promise, a lifetime of embers that only burn in your nameSearched many years
wandered the shadows
of her mind

then reached to explore
the world outside

trek after trek
learning truths
disproving lies

she found the power of her wild
beyond explanation
so she no longer 
bothers
to try

#WyldeVersefire and reflection...
but where are your arms?

#lakelife #pondering https://t.co/LEgsahmimaRosie O'Donnell gives Dems illegally high donations? https://t.co/5rCdpJRQuFBut do you think of me......I may be among the few
who distinguish between
dreams and #fantasy 
Those vivid dreams
brought at night
They're my mind at play
Fantasy comes from
my fully conscious brain
Silly wishes never to fulfill
Yet, dreams can come true
#BeautifulMessConversations with old friends
can remind you 
what‚Äôs real
what‚Äôs fantasy
and at the end of the day
figuring out what matters
matters mostI never feel old until I look up at the trees I‚Äôve planted and see how big they are‚Ä¶How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here..

#PinkFloyd https://t.co/qNzsiahL3Jentangled lovers grow wild here https://t.co/LNvb27QXyeTrying hard not to care
but that‚Äôs just the problem:

I do care.He waits 
For her 
Knowing 
One day 
They'll be together 
And the dream 
Of living 
Their love 
Out loud 
Will become 
Reality 

#FSMPYWhen 
The words fail 
Look 
Into her heart 
And see 
The magic 
That 
Only real love 
Can conjure
Bringing 
Two souls together 
Binding them 
As one 
Forever 

#FSMPYCome home.

Not because you‚Äôre lonely
or feeling guilty.

Come home because
that‚Äôs where you belong.@andibeth012 Please RT! Help save 6 year old Tigre he was dumped by a-hole owners because they didn‚Äôt have time for him. He needs a home where he will be loved and appreciated.
Animals are not things, they are family and if you cannot commit to them don‚Äôt get any!Life becomes shit when it‚Äôs just one missed opportunity after another. Do it.#LadyEPoetry #NoJudgement 
#Live #Laugh #LoveMan is the cruelest animal. - Nietzsche #quote https://t.co/j1cQaP3LwKMeaning and connection
Need it
Want itI don‚Äôt know what day it is
But seasons I know
Spring hearts proliferate
And have begun to move
Across these open fields
Forging a path
Towards its summer
When lips sing thanks
Across its expanse
And a girls winter‚Äôs dreaming
Can come to fruition

#Mayfalls18The Stone Roses' debut LP was released on this day in 1989. Here's the understated press release I was sent back then by the late great Philip Hall (the original scheduled release date was 10 April) https://t.co/FQlGROmLCT#Mood üëäüèº https://t.co/EoIIki13d0'He was sobbing in my arms at the end of every day': Heartbreaking final days of Robin Williams' life as he unknowingly suffered from devastating brain disorder are revealed in new book https://t.co/1AYMSmsekwIceland https://t.co/mJKPRaJQsn~ Sarah Addison Allen https://t.co/I3QXCpD5YXThe best way to break the ice, is to pour whisky over it. üòú https://t.co/Wyh2gWvGJl@NickiSixx12 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates That's ok. I've been hurt before.We are separated by unsaid words and broken promises.The heart is ever so young

and the world betrays us...without agenda, love.I watched him,
his face up to the moonlight,
standing there
contemplating an innocence
long since taken,
wishing
on every strand of absolution surrounding him,
captured in an invalid moment,
one moment.
I cannot forget.
I saw him standing fragile in the moonlight.
I saw him fall.Good sex is about patience but great sex is about a connection that transcends physical wants.Ignited by the damp touch 
Of a hand I‚Äôve never metWhen you spend your life
doing what you love to
do, you are nourishing
your soul.  It doesn‚Äôt
matter what you do,
only that you love it.hope may not heal
but it helps me breathe, todayThe real measure of love is not in its euphoria or passion, but in how it behaves in times of pain and struggle. The deepest love will not abandon you in your despair and weakness. It will find you in the darkness, take your hand, and not let go. https://t.co/Pf3eQ8HHzG@IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates She was answering the question from dispatcher! Are they white? Start at the beginning, before phone disconnected! üôÑ Not racist.However you make someone's day....

Whether you turn them on? 
Make them laugh? 
A compliment?

When you can......Do it

Doesn't cost you anything but timePutting club Loyalties aside.. He‚Äôs a legend who gave everything to Utd ..  hope he pulls through this .. https://t.co/Snt83NekPFTake,
as upon the lips
a kiss,
Drink - deep
from the dark well of all that had gone
  unspoken and hidden,
a nectar,
scented upon thy breath
and dripping,
sweet, and
clear,
and glistening in the sunhttps://t.co/EVVapUTm7IHere at #twilight,
the gradient shift from light,
a ship that‚Äôll take me to the 
other side,
and tho the darkness
is so maligned,
I. roamed unscathed 
in lives conjured from
the night
‚ó¶there will always be light in the shadows...you just need to look close enough https://t.co/FutnZTZfeDLove goes on even if hearts stop caring the way they once did.Back from blue dreams and distant fading lights, back from day dreams and songs bout the night, back from memories of you and what could have been."I go back to the places you used to be searching for any trace left of you...
and all the times I felt most alive".

~ N.R. Hart https://t.co/B56vK3ZiUQRunning away from it all
grey images mesh together 
of a life hardly lived 

shaking my head 
another sip of whiskey 
telling him he should be
fleeing like a rebel 

or get the hell out
too much talk
just get going and smile...

#WrittenRiver #poetryFalling in love is as dangerous
as it is beautiful.and i believe we shall rise
together 
our tattered wings, wholealways choose the adventureThrough the fog I see you, guiding me home... https://t.co/jz3KOgul7WI don't know how to stop loving the things that have hurt me.Nothing changes if you change nothing.chasing my tail chasing your tail

I‚Äôm just tiredMiddle of the night thoughts buzzing around like pesky insects at a picnic, increasing their frantic tempo with every swat.My magic power
I can turn you
Into a poemlast night
I danced
on empty pages
waiting
for your ink
a loud ballet
a silent symphony
I wanted
I waited
I created
the art of pain
without words

#DimpleVersewhen even
forever 
isn‚Äôt long enoughIf passion drives you, let reason hold the reins. -BENJAMIN FRANKLIN@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates How ignorant can you be? It has nothing to do with color. I am white &amp; am asked to take off sunglasses at work when entering certain areas. I couldn‚Äôt wear a hoodie covering my face or have hands in pockets. It‚Äôs called safety. People have been asked to pay attention &amp; report...@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates And if you watch the videos, they were fine with being questioned. Just as anyone who has nothing to hide should be. Complacency is why these mass shootings continue to happen. If the guy in Parkland FL had been dealt with there wouldn‚Äôt have been that shooting. Context!@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates And shootings can‚Äôt happen at Universities? Huh, history seems to disagree. The hands inside the hoodie and face concealed are what is of concern. I work at an airport, with armed officers at times. Depending on threat. Guess I could take that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very obvious...‚Äù as racist eh?@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates So all the Presidents children &amp; families are protected by armed guards, people in prisons are overseen by armed guards to protect their ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô, but our children are not worthy of protection by  trained, RESPONSIBLE individuals? Ah, ‚Äúteacher‚Äù in University explains it!The world is full of charming, beautiful monsters, wanting only, never giving.whisper
words of love
to the ones
who will listen
and to the ones
who will
remember them
forever

And trees grow in her soul
Life flows
Even in the the waxing

She knows chaos
She knows the subdued
And the scope of her wild
But free
She will always be
To roam the earth
