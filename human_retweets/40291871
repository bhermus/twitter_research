✂️ @Wolfbird_NLCC https://t.co/bUgOsvuPcUSince it’s the week before @BiggestLittleFC, I figured this #FursuitFriday we’d learn some useful signs for conventions! (This time including the video with burned-in subtitles for Twitter!)

https://t.co/1D2ByKGUai https://t.co/XCDwlCLyYUI’ve run a ton this week and my paws could use rubs. 

Ohhh, I’ll trade you some high quality fox snugs for paw rubs! 🐾🦊🐾 #FursuitFrday https://t.co/9VgMelE2A5Your life is a result of numerous choices, and cells—in an act of meta metamorphosis—determine their fate in much the same way https://t.co/GDKu4i3OeP https://t.co/JwdJe3Ra1mI'm disappointed that I even need to post this... but here are the accounts I own. If you see me anywhere else, those are IMPOSTER ACCOUNTS. 
Please just ignore them. Thank you! 

I love this fandom, but the blatant theft is too much sometimes.

RT's greatly appreciated. https://t.co/EjJvQjNQAjhttps://t.co/ZlykzriiIxGuess who I managed to contain! 💪🏻🦊 RSPCA are on their way! https://t.co/D5gCOwGD9EHey, I feel like this should be common sense...but since it appears not to be:

If you get my phone number from someone, or somehow find it on your own, DON'T CALL ME. Don't give it to your friends. And PLEASE don't call me over and over again until I answer. It's extremely rude.Adler Update!

Fursuiting is powerful! You can easily make someone's day, cheer up a sad soul, or just make someone smile~

Always remember that fursuiting should be fun! Go out there and make people happy by being a big dumb fluffy animal ❤️ https://t.co/flDnDB3U80***OFFICIAL FULLSUIT GIVEAWAY POST!***
