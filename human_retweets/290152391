Julius Malema you can change the fact that we know your hidden agendas@Mngxitama @Julius_S_Malema @EFFSouthAfrica So the EFF has anointed self as the standard of reason and opinion.
@Mngxitama makes more sound and well thought arguments.
Whats wrong with legitimizing a brother who is fighting the same enemy with a different tactic,angle and on a different level.Only exposes black corruption.

Goes to London, comes back silent about ABSA.

Makes noise and name calling when opposed.

Doesn't want to engage with pro black leaders such as Andile Mngxitama on #LandExpropriation

Julius Malema ladies and gentlemen.Lekota spent 8 years on Robben Island. He dedicated the majority of his life fighting for freedom and defending our constitution. The lack of respect he gets from the spoilt brats is because he speaks hard truths instead of slogans and emotional racial hatred. What a leader. https://t.co/hxKDpuNFFoIf my fave rapper tweeted this , mzansi twitter would be up in arms telling him how tired they're of him telling them about his Bentley.... smh! https://t.co/NnbRU5HvUa😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 What a throwback.

Hello World. Java Script @SelokaM  😍 https://t.co/swHC4EA1TqThe beauty of social media is that a 40 year old economically active citizen holding an honours or masters degree in a credible field can be given advice on how to run an economy by an uneducated and unemployed 20 year old sitting at home using MTN free Twitter.

Are you guys gonna tell her or should I? https://t.co/jLl6nw1ZhFThat "le tlo fologa phela " look #DateMyFamily https://t.co/fKjmGJBEVXAll DJs can relate https://t.co/9A6WOhHLVAMy people are intimidated by men with intelligence and good morals. That's why they hate leaders like Thabo Mbeki, Mmusi Maimane and Ntate Lekota. They associate intelligence and good morals with "whiteness". They want ethnic populist leaders who sing and dance. https://t.co/uVGXK3Va9RYour father Dali Mpofu left such a mess behind as CEO of the SABC that they had to expropriate his job and now he runs around with kids in red overalls promoting Communism after pocketing R11m for not doing his job. Don't talk to us about "Leadership". https://t.co/UWhRIkP7cpSouth Africa has the 3rd worst education system in the world, 50% of students drop out of the system, while only 30% get the marks requires to get into Uni. But let's change the name of the CT airport, because that will really improve our lives hey. Vuvuzela politics. Unreal ffs.The EFF needs to stop using China as an example to spread their Communist agenda. China has a Capitalist economy and is the global factory to the world. They have exported their way to prosperity. The only things South Africa produces is alcohol, dagga, wheat, and prostitution.When against Zuma we said the law is the law, politics aside. Today it’s against Malema we are speaking in tongues.The Public Protector found that Julius Malema inappropriately benefitted from tenders. The NPA is incompetent so an alternate org wants to get involved. If you are angry at #Afriforum instead of the politician who stole R52m from the poor then you are just as corrupted as him.What Julius Malema did in Limpopo is no different to what Jacob Zuma, the Gupta's and Schabir Shaik did. Tender fraud is ruining our SOE's and municipalities. This results in the government increasing our taxes, VAT and energy prices to recoup the money lost due to fraud. Unreal.Malema must do the honourable thing and resign from parliament just like he wanted Zuma gone for being accused of the same thing he is accused.

Superior logic dictates 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
#Afriforum #MalemaI'm not a racist. I will support #Afriforum in their attempt to tackle corruption against state officials. We don't care whether the cat is black or white, along as it catches the mice."Im now equal to whites" says the Fanonist without Fanon. Its tragic the levels of inferiority complex ravaging the souls of black leaders. They taking us right back to the zone of white terror. We gotta go back to the  basics of black consciousness urgently.J. Cole trapped us in a basement, confiscated our phones and made us listen to a trash album. The man is a fucking terroristFormer Deputy President of the ANCYL and current NEC member of the ANC #RonaldLamola will be conferred with his second Masters Degree at the University of Pretoria today, congrats cadre @MYANC @ANCYLhqLMAOOOOOO OKAY 👍🏽 https://t.co/EnclA0uimoThat's why I only listen to the money Paper got no emotions plus e chaza basadi #FavNyovestLyrics - @CassperNyovestPrince Kaybee is currently the ambassador for men are trash. 

Dude refused to pay R2500 for child support but is outchea paying registration fees for 10 complete strangersI note how the enemy has become Adelaide Tambo. No mention of the apartheid mass murderers who are sitting home peacefully as we go after each other as blacks. #STRATCOM is succeeding once again. Agent provocateurs are also comrades. The ten days of great deception.All we wanna know is... https://t.co/licKX9ATtUOne has to bring things to tweeter level. Did Winnie fight for names of airports that are used by those who brutalized her and her people to b named after her?

It was foolhardy of @EFFSouthAfrica to boastfully say that they'll vote @AtholT out as Mayor, before actual vote. Above all, SA is maturing as a democracy &amp; rejects racial politics.Me: I need to go study I have a test tomorrow.
