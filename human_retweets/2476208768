Dear Tito Sotto, mas mali yung magmanyak ng babae kesa uminom. Does PEPSI PALOMA ring a bell? Fcking pig."Kababae mong tao shot-shot ka."

"Umiinom ka na, naka-shorts ka pa!"

EB COULD BE A BETTER SHOW WITHOUT TITO SOTTO AND JOSE'S SEXIST POVS.bakit ba relevant si tito sotto  https://t.co/SmgtXqACPFPeople: *defending Tito Sotto*

Me: https://t.co/Sqtcj9XOvv@pocahontascruz omg and remember when tito sotto called the entire pepsi paloma scandal a "gimmick"?Tangina nyo tito sotto at jose manalo. Isa ka pa wally. At lahat ng tumawa at pumalakpak na nasa broadway. Mga gago https://t.co/pKXTnIqoUuTito Sotto is reason enough for me to stop watching Eat Bulaga. He seriously drags the show &amp; his colleagues down.To those watching @EatBulaga let's not forget that Tito sotto was talking to a married woman with kids. Conservatism is not sexism.Tito Sotto just gives us more reasons to love him. https://t.co/cpYblrOWkaAdd Tito Sotto's comments to that and see how men shame women from beginning to end. https://t.co/6apB9qRgnQThis is disgusting. Can't believe people as horrible as Tito Sotto are in the senate.  https://t.co/SMVRtrujVfI don't understand women who defend Tito Sotto for his misogynistic remarks. You are all supposed to call him out for it, not join him.'Kabataang babae, drinking with boys, nagagahasa.'

Girls, wag na rin kayo pumayag for dinner, lunch and merienda. Bwiset.Mukhang.  https://t.co/vZNhGsbzMn@mgvtrb Any way for GMA to do something about this? https://t.co/Jbbtd4H667Typical Tito Sotto. Tsk. A lawmaker who doesn't understand his laws. The super macho senator.  https://t.co/Qyal8P68EjIf anyone of you agrees with Tito Sotto and his ilk on my previous tweets, please unfollow me na. Pero let me know so I can unfollow you.@krizzy_kalerqui Will somebody please tell us in a civilized language what Tito Sotto said so I can join in insulting him?If you're a man agreeing with Tito Sotto shaming that poor woman on TV, we'd better warn YOUR female friends not to get drunk with you, no?We live in a dangerous world because of Tito Sotto and people who think like him.
