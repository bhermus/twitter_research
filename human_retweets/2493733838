hi everyone. please help a poorlieber out and retweet this. thank you ❤ https://t.co/fdakTwXbTvme trying to listen to other artists since Justin's not releasing anything new https://t.co/VD10cJhaP2using Twitter after you said goodnight https://t.co/kI9dbdFFFkCan't you read? He literally said he didn't agree with Kanye, but he is trying to spread positivity instead of hate. People should speak up on important topics unlike your fave who stays mute on everything even on a mic during her performances. https://t.co/xlLW2XSbgXthe reason why justin is getting dragged and not like john legend is bc he is a "white canadian" therefore he has no say about the kanye situationY'all know Justin is a positive and loving person so why are you surprised? He wasn't agreeing with him at all so stop dragging himTravis better get a paternity test because damn💀 https://t.co/EhYAEzawPfto @ArianaGrande https://t.co/AfeSFFVUjCBlac Chyna is high key a predator.
