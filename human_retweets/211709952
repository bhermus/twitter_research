And it’s a powerful symbol of why fewer and fewer cities around the world want to host the Olympics." https://t.co/0JuEnfGJ8vIt’s pretty sad how liberals say 18 year olds are too immature to buy guns then turn around &amp; let 8 year olds decide their own gender &amp; give them hormone blockers.Nobody can reasonably deny that the left are the new authoritarians.

I grew up in the time when the right was constantly trying to ban and censor offensive comedy, speech, literature and music.

How times have changed.Amazing job, @benshapiro!

This is the best 90 second summary of socialism I have ever heard.

However, this basic logic will still go over the heads of most liberals. https://t.co/3BKHkK6Em6So if you post this meme to any of the kiddies that the left is supporting, it will get you a time out for encouraging supporting self harm or suicide.
