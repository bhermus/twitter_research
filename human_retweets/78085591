- that is his 8th 5 wicket haul in Test Cricket.
- Brett Lee had 10 in his career.

Padmaavat ko pakistan mein b release kardo😂ye saley karni sena waley pakistaniyo ko b pel k ajjayenge .PM tells Times Now how great demonetisation was, PM tells Zee News not to judge him on demonetisation. 🤔Advertisements which even 90’s kids would not have seen. Thread.Demonetisation was the massive loot of pockets of poor people of India. Not any multimillionaire cried due to demonetisation.
