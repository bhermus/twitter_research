He who does not trust, 
will not be trusted. 
     — Lao TzuYou have to trust the delays and roadblocks. Not getting what you want is a blessing in disguise. You will always get redirected to what you need.“Worrying is carrying tomorrow’s load with today’s strength- carrying two days at once. It is moving into tomorrow ahead of time. Worrying doesn’t empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength.”

— Corrie ten BoomExpectations always lead to frustrations. Expectations are the seeds, and frustration is the crop that sooner or later you will have to reap. It is your own doing.

What people don’t say is all the details I need.Holding my son in my arms,
watching him take
his first breath of life
I realised that he
“contains” everything
as he is right now.

He is whole, perfect
and complete...
...lacking nothing.

In that moment
I grasped that
the concept of lack
is just an “illusion”
of time and space.Maybe we need to change our wording...

Replace "I think" with-

-"habitual patterns of memory respond as"

There is no thinker.

There are only thoughts derived from memory/experience.

Understand this with all of your Being, and this is Freedom.From a Buddhist perspective, even if all material problems could be solved, suffering would remain. The world is unfixable, said Buddha. Happiness depends, ultimately, only on the mind; it is the mind that can, should, and must be fixed.
