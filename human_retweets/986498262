For more information: https://t.co/CVu6cz1BOc https://t.co/DtX3uecgSZI am a Thomasian alumni and I strongly denounce the award given to Mocha Uson. With all due respect, Uson doesn‚Äôt even embody the University‚Äôs values. That award doesn‚Äôt reflect on the other Thomasians‚Äô point of view.mga tomasino, pwede nang mamili:
