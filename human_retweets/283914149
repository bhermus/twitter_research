There is a difference between who we love, who we settle for, and who we are meant for.A person who loved you will never let you go, no matter the situation.Take the risk or lose the chance.i love you, whether it's wrong or rightPeople spend too much time looking for more, instead of appreciating what they already have.I‚Äôm just thankful for the people that never left me in my life, my family, my best friends and God, I love them all.The best kind of relationship is when they're not only your lover, but your best friend too.I can be a choice, a priority, a reason, but never an option. üëäIgnore me? Okay that's cool, just don't be mad when I do it to you.Letting go of the past is your first step to happiness.If you love someone, be brave enough to tell them, otherwise, be brave enough to watch them be loved by someone else.if i tell you that i am so in love with you, would everything change?Hindi ka nga seen-zoned, ignore-zoned naman. üíîJust believe. God's time is always the perfect time.Psychology claims, that mood where everything irritates you indicates that you're actually missing someoneWhen fear knocks on the door, answer with faith!It is what it is. Accept it and move on.A friend who understands your tears is much more valuable than a lot of friends who only know your smile.Psychology says that too much stress literally causes the human brain to freeze and shut down temporarily.Mentally, the worst feeling is feeling unwanted by the one person you want the most...Limitations hurt your happiness.Psychology: When she is happy, she can‚Äôt stop talking, when she is sad she doesn't say a word.Tumatawa lang pero nagseselos na pala.Smile, because although you may be having a bad day, you have food, clean water, clothes, a home and your health. You are blessed. üòá‚òùüíïWhat is meant to be will always find you. God will make sure of it.Dear Someone, no one can change the way I feel about you, I love everything about you, I fall for you, for who you really are.Haayy..
