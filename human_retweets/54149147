#BuddhaPurnima https://t.co/a6Bnyl2GsjBuddha would not accept followers for the simple reason that to accept a follower is to destroy his dignity. He accepted only fellow travellers. His last statement before dying was, “If I ever come back, I will come as your friend.” Maitreya means the friend. #BuddhaPurnima https://t.co/Ugkba1ZcQe"We are shaped by our thoughts, we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like shadow that never leaves " - Gautam Buddha.
