#VegasBorn https://t.co/bdl4f5SbeKThe Golden Knights have 3 takeaways through 2 periods of Game 4. 

Game 1: 17
Game 2: 26
Game 3: 4

The forecheck is gone. It needs to come back and in a hurry.Sharks try the exact same thing, it opens up to a chance, but the play is blown dead for interference. EXACT same play, refs see it this time. VGK to PP.Sharks have an asterisk disclaimer subject to change for their projected lines sheet for Game 4. Goodrow on the top line. Thornton/Donskoi are scratched and Ryan is in for Martin.On a mission....
