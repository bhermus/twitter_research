Dragging abortion out of the backstreet, saving countless lives and protecting women from the dangers of unsafe abortion.Good for the LibDems taking this on, continuing criminalisation of abortion  is indefensible. https://t.co/MMSNWP67vhWant to support #repealthe8th campaign but note sure how?

Not clear Scottish system will cover this. 6/English system will allow NI women to make appointment in advance. Scot system likely to require a referral through sexual health clinic. 5/A surgical abortion takes 5 to 10 minutes and most women can go home a few hours later. This is readily available in England. 4/Now mostly medical abortions in Scot NHS. Up to 48 hours between first and second sets of pills. No access to one day abortion. 3/Although legal up to 24 weeks in Scot, in reality access limited after 12 weeks. Scots often travel to England after 18-20 weeks. 2/After UK Gov announcement today, very unlikely Northern Irish women will choose Scot for abortion even when it becomes free. Here's why. 1/Supreme court challenge to NI #abortion law starts tmw. Our laws carry harshest criminal penalties in Europe.
