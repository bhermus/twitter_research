@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now. https://t.co/bg9pVtkdOvThis tweet is now evidence in an ongoing federal criminal investigation into Obstruction and Witness Tampering.

McCabe's firing will haunt Mr. Trump just as Comey's firing did, and will eventually help unmask Trump as the unrepentant, risible criminal he is and always has been. https://t.co/96XgRzqg0qAll time choke job.    I'm not sure the punishment for that in Bama?   Rather be Kfc right now.Hahahahahaha https://t.co/9BfapDD6IQWhy did @FCC and @AjitPaiFCC rush this vote on #NetNeutrality despite known fraud &amp; criminal activity in the public process? I look forward to Chairman Pai one day testifying under oath to Congress as to why he ignored 18 Attorneys General. Did Chairman Pai aid and abet fraud? https://t.co/KK6kfWUk7PThis is an egregious attack on our democracy. The end of #NetNeutrality protections means that the internet will be for sale to the highest bidder. When our democratic institutions are already in peril, we must do everything we can to stop this decision from taking effect. https://t.co/8GGrJFMdrUThank you ALABAMA!!I was just handed a 479-page tax bill a few hours before the vote. One page literally has hand scribbled policy changes on it that can‚Äôt be read. This is Washington, D.C. at its worst.  Montanans deserve so much better. https://t.co/q6lTpXoXS0Once again, the Trump administration sides with big money and against democracy. If this passes, the internet and its free exchange of information as we have come to know it will cease to exist.  #NetNeutrality https://t.co/1oKLkWOpYn.@realDonaldTrump When my brother was killed, Pres Bush listened while I screamed at him &amp; then held me as I sobbed, you fat fucking liar. https://t.co/SEIw74OeZGThe hope - and I know this is Pop's hope - is that him speaking out can clear space so people who aren't white, male vets can speak. (2/3)@POTUS "To lie about how previous @potus' responded to deaths of soldiers‚Äìis as low as it gets. He's a soulless coward." https://t.co/t4sK0QYWO3Pop on Trump: "Unfit intellectually, emotionally, &amp; psychologically to hold this office &amp; the whole world knows it." https://t.co/t4sK0QYWO3"The people around this @POTUS should be ashamed because they know how unfit he is, yet they choose to do nothing." https://t.co/t4sK0QYWO3Just spoke to Gregg Popovich who called Trump a "soulless coward" for lying about Obama &amp; Bush not calling families of fallen soldiers...Sportsmanship, pass it on. https://t.co/AJ2NmAnsM5‚ÄòNo Way To Prevent This,‚Äô Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens https://t.co/LMg4mj6LFn https://t.co/FZuB4iWFOiThinking NFL players are 'protesting the flag' is like thinking Rosa Parks was protesting public transportationScience Fiction, available now: https://t.co/e0QmDjEVQW https://t.co/r3pNXiCEnR.@realDonaldTrump, you are embarrassing our country and the millions of Americans who fought and died to defeat Nazism.If you're angry about #doctor13 possibly being a woman, just remember:
