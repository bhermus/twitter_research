THATS THE THEORY

LMAO 

ctto #singularity https://t.co/gWHXbTH4N8Ïïó #singularity https://t.co/YjQiajLpIKDoesn't happen every time, but when people are asking @BTS_twt questions in English &amp; Namjoon is answering them, you see the rest of the boys nodding their heads, but it's not cause they don't understand, it's actually cause someone's translating for them through their earpiecesSo this just came out.

That's not just ARMY anymore, not with those numbers. That's general public interest.

And understand this. BTS gets more DAILY views than some music artists will EVER get.

Let that sink in. https://t.co/Lj43RU6bvxAll of this and we don't even fully have the American general public on board yet. This is just fandom and word of mouth power.

To say ARMY isn't prepared for what's about to happen with this comeback is an understatement. A huge huge understatement.

We ain't ready.They're working with huge names in America as well. Spotify, YouTube, etc. Most American artists couldn't even dream to have names like those advertising their music for them.

Then there's BTS over here just like, Sup. ++&amp; ELLEN invited BTS back to her show. &amp; she's the only one we know about so far. One of the biggest shows in America asked BTS to comeback.

Again, there are whole American music artists that would LOVE to just be casually asked to be on Ellen even once, let alone twice. ++And the comeback album doesn't even have cover art. No track list. Nothing. Just pre-orders. But it's already #8 most sold album on Amazon for 2018, directly competing with the biggest names in the American music industry.

And that's pre-orders of an unreleased album. ++But ARMY were casually invited in a tweet by one person, not even by the companies themselves, to help and we finished the goal in hours WITHOUT BTS even knowing about it.

There's no expert that could have predicted that. ++And yesterday ARMY completely derailed &amp; finished a million dollar advertising and fundraising campaign that was suppose to take a month to complete, by MAJOR American companies with multimillion dollar advertising departments with DECADES of experience planning these things. ++And BTS is gonna be performing along side American music legends at the BBMAs like Cher and John Legend. The whole BBMA is stacked like that this year. Huge huge artists.

And NO ONE is doubting that BTS should be there. It's just accepted. ++Like that is the stuff of career goals for American music artists. And a whole Korean group did that.

Industry experts are casually calling BTS "mega-stars" and they don't actually know much about them. They just know BY WORD OF MOUTH in the industry that BTS is THAT BIG. ++I'm not sure ARMY understand what's happening.

BTS sold out three nights at the Staples Center, on a solo tour, and was so in demand they added a fourth night.

There are whole ass well-known AMERICAN music artists that WISH they could do that. ++
