#NagaLeaksI miss you and I just hate that feeling.https://t.co/ei5RnDfXT1For those who wants to take a glimpse of how Duterte operates, here's an article from Patmei, Duterte... https://t.co/TPg7CcB8fKExpect nothing and you will never be disappointed.Just because I don‚Äôt react, doesn‚Äôt mean I didn't notice.She is hurting, a lot more than you think.I hate it when you're always there for people, but when you need someone, nobody's there for you.I miss the old us.I dont judge. I just say what i feel.I just need a day off from reality, just a day without people, problems, and all the bullshits that run through my mind.Some things are better left unsaid.Ang hirap din palang magpanggap na masaya ka at okay ka.The worst feeling is when you find out you didn't mean as much to someone as you thought you did and you look stupid for caring too much.I'm the nicest rude person you'll ever met.I am 3% human 97% stress.I say bad words to express my anger, not to say that I'm a bad person.Its funny how you can do nice things for someone all the time and they never notice, but if you make one mistake, it's never forgotten.Just trust God and everything will be alright.Mabait akong tao, pero marunong din akong makiramdam pag umaabuso na kayo.Don‚Äôt ask for my opinion and get mad when I tell you the truth.Time will come that you'll realize you had a lot of effort wasted on someone who's not even deserving for it.Sometimes, it's good to pretend that we don't care.All those bullshits made me strong.Kelangan mo rin sumuko minsan kasi alam mong wala ng patutunguhan. Kelangan mo na lang tanggapin at magsimula ulit.Power voting naman!üëç

https://t.co/x84uMv6oB0Moving on doesn't mean forgetting, it means you choose happiness over hurt.Even the best fall down sometimes.Once you walk out of my life, the door locks behind you.Sana balang araw, masabi ko rin na ang lahat ng sakit ay worth it.The more I give people the benefit of the doubt, the more they prove they do not deserve it. #wakeupMUST READ AND SPREAD, ALRIGHT!
