Big thank you to @GovofCO for signing #SB66! This bill supports sustainable @ColoLottery funding for @GreatOutdoorsCO, the Conservation Trust Fund and @COParksandWildlife. We'll high-five to that! https://t.co/eWVggdlzGUYEAAAAAH. My dream for America is that we all have @Togoware kits with us at all times and never use a plastic utensil ever again. https://t.co/jz9bHtiYR1To pique interest about the indigenous history of outdoor places many of us love, Native American climber @lennecefer of @NativesOutdoors uses Instagram and Facebook https://t.co/LDWZl2fS9h via @Dunfee_Ryan @sierraclubWouldn't it be lovely if this was a viable option for this week, rather than work? But then again, maybe this is LIFE... The Ultimate Journey. May yours be an exciting adventure and along the scenic route.. ‚ù§üåç #travel #TravelChatSA https://t.co/XTlbSbB1u8SLC is saying "no straw, please" and I am so stoked to see my city doing this. Patronize restaurants participating in #StrawlessinSLC. Support this movement. https://t.co/zZTdxWbwwQ"It's General Leia, not princess." I love this.
