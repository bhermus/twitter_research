Former #MagyarNemzet employees (incl. former dep. editor-in-chief #ZsomborGyörgy) are publishing a new weekly called #MagyarHang (Hungarian Voice). 0. edition will be distributed on the oppo demo next Tuesday, 1st edition will be on stands on 18th of May.My favorite podcast these days is @jkglei's Hurry Slowly. Maybe the title has been too inspiring for my approach to @thirdwavelist.

Nonetheless, @anthonymonori has been working while I didn't. And soon we are to publish 150 cafés across 25 cities. (Design is also being updated!) https://t.co/hbjbl9wxN8
