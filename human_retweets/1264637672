Pengeng inspirasyon yung totoo sawa nako sa joke lang.💕Jennie &amp; Lisa 💕 @ygofficialblink https://t.co/mNR4TkmgFrif it happens, it happens. don't force it."Why do you have trust issues?"

My parents exchanged vows in front of God inside his church. However, my dad cheated and broke his vow to my mom. Knowing that humans are capable of such unfaithfulness even breaking a sacred vow. Now tell me, should I really trust anyone at all?Sana's in life:

1. Sana kuminis mukha ko.
2. Sana dumami pera ko.
3. Sana maging tayo."and the problem is, we learned how to love someone but not how to handle love at its worst."Open for a surprise 🙏 https://t.co/KfqW77VMZJi miss you, but fuck you.i want to be your... "tangina di ko na papakawalan to".one day, i'll be someone's:

PAG INIWAN KA DI KA MAHAL.
PAG BINABALEWALA KA DI KA MAHAL.
PAG KAYA KANG TIISIN DI KA MAHAL.mag twitter ka is ok

mag parami ka ng followers is ok

pero yung i-unfollow moko pagkatapos kitang i-follow is not definitely ok.if u see someone being interrupted in a conversation, acknowledge them, don’t let them be pushed to the side. if u see someone lagging behind, walk beside them. if someone is being ignored, include them. always remind people of their worth, a small gesture can mean a lot.lagyan mo ng "HAHAHA" para less drama:

“iniwan na niya 'ko HAHAHA”
“gago ang sakit sakit HAHAHA”
“pota wala nakong pera HAHAHA”
“may mahal na siyang iba HAHAHA”
“us2 ko na mamatay HAHAHA”akala ata nila bulbol lang yung aso ko basta lang inahit ah potaNGINA I'M SO MAD https://t.co/tFAzloh8Z1“Love always was and always will be incessant care, being there without being asked to, making fun of yet smiling at the other's quirks, and feeling an ineffable comfort and sense of security that almost feels like home.” https://t.co/6zYrMO7drLdon't worry, someday.. makaka attend ka din sa concert ng favorite mo. keep believing... with effort. all the love ❤️tonight i will look up at the moon and i will know that somewhere you are looking at it too https://t.co/hp16GLRkwo❒Taken ❒Single ✔ Dont care anymore.Kanang feeling bai ba na you want to do something, pero you're too lazy af, ataya my life.Pilit mong tinatago yung sakit na nararamdaman mo : https://t.co/bvupEsNg7SBetter act like you care before I act like I never met youDili man gani ko kebaw mutabok, mag-uyab uyab pa kaha?

* Walang ka-chat sa FB Messenger
* Gustong maglabas ng galit sa mundo

pinagpalit? - okay lang
sinaktan? - okay lang
kinalimutan? - okay lang
pinaasa? - okay lang
nagbago? - okay lang

okay lang. kase kahit hindi naman okay wala pa ring magbabago diba? kaya mapapa-okay na lang ako. no choice eh. 🙃me to my profs: https://t.co/jEPRNjoGmSStop measuring how big your problem is, focus on how big your God is.sobrang liberal yung mindset na "just because we have different opinions, doesn't mean i'm wrong. respetuhin mo na lang."

no, stop right there. if your opinion demeans, harrasses, or endangers the lives of others, i will never respect it.The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging, and you have to act like you don't care at all.
