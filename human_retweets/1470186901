I disagree with this bullshit farcical statement, the shooter is a terrorist and the law of the land shouldn’t give two hoots about his emotions and neither should any @PTIofficial leader act as an apologist for this murderous lot. @fawadchaudhry https://t.co/pqgvCAfXZWKhan Sahib @ImranKhanPTI please stop @ShkhRasheed from inflaming khatm-e-nabuwat issue at PTI jalsas. I can tell you from experience in the crowds that Sheikh Rasheed's two minutes are the most cringe worthy part of the jalsa and have no traction among PTI loyalists in attendanceif you ever feel dumb, just know that when my friend was 14 she went to a psychiatrist bc she “had a voice in her head”. it was her brain. like literally just her thoughts. she thought that she was the only person who had the ability to think. for 14 years.Do you know who your husband is? https://t.co/GbMOQeijQxPMLN pointing out people responsible for stoking khatam e nabuwat fire https://t.co/QklalBiZCWAhsan Iqbal was the interior minister who allowed these TLYR goons to sit around one month and take the capital hostage. PMLN even bowed down to the TLYR demand of changing QAU department name. You didn’t think the chickens would come home to roost?especially Capt Safdar, husband of future PML-N president &amp; SIL of Quaid for life, who only yesterday exploited the issue to discredit the achievements of Prof Salam inside Parliament, &amp; PML-N let him. https://t.co/6UvSOoSqKhEstablishment? Did the establishment invoke Fatwa against Salman Taseer? Did the establishment made PMLN use religion against BB Shaheed in the 90s? UNBELIEVABLE! This is on PMLN all the way, please do not Spin it for the sake of memory of BB and other victims. https://t.co/0HRk5cWzfrI long for the day when Patwaris will be able to distinguish between Government-funded and Private-funded projects.

 https://t.co/8QAU5dEdQkThis is basically every Pakistani Weekend Commie and socialist revolutionary. https://t.co/Ac6AADK273IK s been in more leadership roles than you and has delivered in each one. He's self made, principled, and a visionary. Precisely the kind of qualities that Nawaz and you lack. When people think of leaders they picture someone like IK not Ahsan Iqbal or Maryam Nawaz lol. https://t.co/arj2h0aaydI once taught an 8 am college class. So many grandparents died that semester. I then moved my class to 3 pm. No more deaths.

Instead I'll give it to someone who's driven it off a cliff 3 times in the past. https://t.co/p1vJvtfHpHYou had Nawaz Sharif delay the merger/integration of FATA for the past 2 years just because he and Ishaq Dar wanted to keep a bigger pie from the Fed Rev for Punjab so that the next election could be secured. He used touts like Fazl ur Rehman and Achakzai to front this oppositionSo a big hurrah for all the rape apologists like Najam Sethi, the scum that works at The News/Geo and happy socks who think that Nawaz represents some sort of uniting force for the federation or a development focused Messiah with an economic vision.So Nawaz's only success during this regime has been the securing of a lot of foreign debt and his pure luck that international fuel prices fell so low that we could control our CA deficit. Now only pure suck ups would call those two as a success of Nawaz's economic vision.The increase in power generation is supposed to be another feather in the current govt's cap. However, no one bothers to look into how much of that increase in capacity is being utilized and whether the cost of their capacity  charges will cripple the power sector going fwdOnly a PM with double digit IQ could have been obsessed about keeping the FX rate stable while the rest of the economy goes to shit. Ishaq Dar who had his own ulterior motives knew that the dunderhead at the top could be busy with the 1 USD /100 Rs rate as a child with a rattler.True to form, Abbasr Nasir comes with a piece that is supposed to be condemnation for PMLN's misogynist behaviour but ends up being a couched apology for the party's carefully planned actions while equating its actions with PTI.

Pakistani Journalists on Twitter: Never has such depth in political understanding been shown by a political leader. Outstanding. Fantastic. What a speech.an "evolved" way of saying people come to pti jalsas for poondi. can't really use that word cos would hurt alleged "liberal" cred but will wrap it up in a halal concert jibe instead. https://t.co/rHJKihROw7behind every serial killer, is a woman who is definitely at fault somehow for not wanting to date the type of guy who turned out to be a serial killer https://t.co/fdgHJYMQfGliberati pre pti jalsa: no enthusiasm, too hot, people sick of political activity. 

liberati post pti jalsa: too many people, political theater, real jalsa (one we care about cos preserves r favored status quo party) was ignored, boo we no consider this legit political activity!no he didn't. classic example of so called reporters pushing own agenda by quoting out of context e-gs. he was honing in on how a corrupt ruling elite leads to the decline of an entire people. but please continue with your hot takes. someone might consider it truth. https://t.co/YfbFxIXusRAnyone who has ever been to a jalsa knows it's no walk in the park.

Xposed! https://t.co/hBCHYv6xcqsabahat you and your 5 friends on Twitter need to get together and figure out a game plan. you lot can't keep complaining about the content being repetitive and then sell it off as entertainment later. it's embarrassing to see people like you who are paid to write phone in views. https://t.co/rHJKihROw7IK to FATA : aap Pakistani hein, aap mere hein, aap humaray hein.Woke crowd and The News staff right now. https://t.co/VmTlbb9GxrSo far the awaam has voted for Nawaz flavoured gobar, let us hope they try something new this time around https://t.co/MZ4iQ3H6KVEpic speech.

And despite his very human flaws, he is only focused on making Pakistan the very best Pakistan can be?
 
I write on Imran Khan: https://t.co/1LCgBOpiSi@dawn_com don't have to read this crap to know what trash he's peddling this week. JKT was dq'd for same reasons as Kh Asif. He doesn't belong to PML-N. IK put through same scrutiny &amp; answered every single one of the petitioner's trivial complaints even proved he played cricket in the 80s!Today is one of the happiest &amp; most fulfilling days of my life as I see SKMCH accredited by US Joint Commission International. This means that after a thorough audit lasting for days, SKMCH has been recognised internationally as a provider of  world class services.Jibran wants someone to attack IK's personal life in court but has to keep lib cred intact so won't say so openly.

But there's no reasonable room to argue that he ought not to be disqualified.Legit room to debate the SC verdict, but no matter how one looks at it, NS ki disqualification banti hai. 3 chances to explain his wealth where he clearly lied and failed to explain Panama.

Disqualifications for life under Article 62(1)(f) have happened again (Lehri’s case) and again (Junejo’s case). The SC only upheld what it had already decided. 

Like how Nawaz had already decided he wouldn’t amend Article 62 in 2010.If we remove our partisan lens we also end up wondering why couldn't there be a trial in the first place.
