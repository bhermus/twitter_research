I often ask myself what is the purpose of our lives and I conclude that life's purpose is to be happy. We have no guarantee what will happen in the future, but we live in hope. That's what keeps us going.Perhaps the way to meet tomorrow's challenges is not to use yesterday's solutions, but to dare to try that which was previously out of the question.Avicii donated millions to fight hunger and HIV/AIDS during years of charitable efforts https://t.co/9FFXLa7DyA https://t.co/C38lU4v6tv"Before you act, listen. 
 Before you react, think.
 Before you spend, earn.
 Before you criticize, wait.
 Before you pray, forgive.
 Before you quit, try."

His Parents are so strong"We live in a country where if you want to bomb somebody, there‚Äôs remarkably little discussion about how much it might cost. But when you discuss whether or not we can assist people who are suffering, then suddenly we become very cost-conscious." - Prof. Andrew BacevichShami Chakrabarti being forced to explain why breaking international law is not a good thing. The mind boggles. #r4todayTheresa May will defend her decision to authorise airstrikes against Syria in front of MPs.
But Labour's Shami Chakrabarti says the PM should have discussed it with parliament. https://t.co/V9Sg0e0b4p‚ÄòThere got money for wars, but can‚Äôt feed the poor‚Äô #TupacWith NO majority, in power only with DUP support paid for with ¬£1.5bn of taxpayers money, Theresa May has bombed Syria WITHOUT presenting EVIDENCE to Parliament &amp; deliberately timed to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. Is this seriously what she has learned from Iraq?
#Syria strikeTwo quotes for this moment:

Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.

‚Äî Martin Luther King

War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.

‚Äî George OrwellWe live in strange times when you wake up in the morning and your first instinct is to check nobody started WW3 without you.The problem of disinformation on Facebook isn't just limited to groups that steal your personal information. Check out a new paper I worked on that explains how political groups take advantage of microtargeting and legal loopholes to spread misinformation https://t.co/ys9ymWxkbd https://t.co/bKk8MhhZnOOur unfortunate and brutal history of waging regime change wars has failed. Interventions in Iraq and Libya caused death, destruction, and human suffering. We have neglected our own communities. Military action should be the last resort, not our first.It is vital that parliament has the chance to debate and decide in advance on any government proposals to support a new US-led military intervention in Syria, which risks a dangerous escalation of the conflict.The cruelest form of evil is harming an innocent child. What is happening to the world we live in??? These people should be given the most severe punishment there is! Where are we heading as humanity? 
Shaken to my core.

How about you just make me Twitter CEO, I fix it, and people get what they want without delay? I would also make Twitter profitable by Thursday. #TwitterTakeoverToday we mourn the children who lost their lives in the Syrian war, the families seeking refuge, and the homes and streets that once meant so much to Syrians. Yet what we must mourn more ardently after seven years, is the futility of the world‚Äôs attempts to end the conflict.‚ÄúGreat strength... comes from the will to live a full and passionate life.‚Äù

RIP Stephen HawkingBe careful of those fake positive people, the ones that be promoting positive things, but being negative about everything anyone‚Äôs doing if it ain‚Äôt them.In today‚Äôs materialistic world there is a risk of people becoming slaves to money, as though they were simply cogs in a huge money-making machine. This does nothing for human dignity, freedom, and genuine well-being. Wealth should serve humanity, and not the other way around.21 years ago today, the world lost the Notorious B.I.G. A prolific storyteller &amp; hip-hop legend, his contributions to the culture are still extremely relevant today. üíØ

So hard to learn your craft and earn a living now it's all down to blogging.I know this is the world we've constructed for ourselves, but it's still a little jarring to read a serious thread about serious issues, get to the end, and see "We want to be transparent, so Mr. Donut will be answering your questions soon"  https://t.co/I6Di3PeKmvThis speech is filled with the kind of waffle you pad out a high-school essay with when it's due in the morning and you haven't studied. #RoadtoBrexit
