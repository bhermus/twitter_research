When your banker says your account is overdrawn, you don’t say, ‘That’s true for you but not for me.’” @ricebroocks https://t.co/qIUPRxHJer"I remember Christian teachers telling me long ago…hate the sin but not the sinner. How could you hate what a man did and not hate the man? But years later it occurred to me that there was one man to whom I had been doing this all my life -- namely myself."
