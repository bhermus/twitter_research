#DIPG primarily affects children and there is a 0% survival rate. That's right... ZERO.

They need all the help they can get. Please consider donating to help them fund the research to find a cure. https://t.co/w6ruCHWnbLMarch is #CerebalPalsyAwarenessMonth! 

Co-Founder @RDLee's daughter, Tori, is 1 of the 2 reasons behind why this cause exists. She suffers from #CerebralPalsy but despite her many limitations, she still manages to lives a happy life &amp; smile constantly. She is an inspiration. üíö https://t.co/s1AvubROZ4This is seriously awesome. Wow! Hey @OriginalFunko, since you're feeling generous, can @PopsForPatients also have $1 million worth of POP! toys to donate too? üòâüòâüòâ #WorthAShot https://t.co/zOo3VL17zv@realellsworth I would pay to see @SaviorTKO take this belt from you at a future @HouseofHardcore event! üôÉToday is the last day of #CHDAwarenessWeek. Our poster boy, #BraxtynsHeart suffers from this harsh disease. He is half the reason that this cause exists. #CHD affects #1in100 children, is gravely underfunded, and needs all the support it can get. Please help us spread awareness. https://t.co/tA2PKLa7dRHey all my peeps in the Nashville area! @SaviorTKO Would you guys want to go help out a wonderful rescue that would love nothing more than to have you guys simply walk some of their fur babies?
