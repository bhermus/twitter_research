Climate change is the biggest threat facing #NationalParks. And with the Trump administration's push to repeal key climate protections, there's a lot at stake for some of America's favorite places -- like @GlacierNPS.  https://t.co/3Yj7JPs7ktLove this visual!  A lesson for us all! https://t.co/cXfM5ZFLFsDear AAU parents,

1. Screaming about an incorrect score is not going to change it any faster. 

2. There is no rule (in any level of basketball) that says team fouls are supposed to be even.

Thank you. 

Have a lovely Sunday.Iowa, spread the message and help get Jake home safety! https://t.co/VnGehNTt3j‚ÄúYou need to be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins.‚Äù -- Jim StovallDear AAU coaches,

Here's why: https://t.co/CQ90oJCX9HChris Kyle the greatest american sniper in military history was shot and killed when confronted by a "crazy guy" with a gun. So we just have to train the teachers a lil bit better than Chris Kyle.If a gunman can walk into a military base like Fort Hood with 100% of the populace 'highly trained" in firearms use, and still murder 13 people with a pistol, do you honestly think that 20% of teachers having a gun is going to stop the next killer who may have an AR-15?Warning: this tweet is political.

I own an AR-15. I've used it for target shooting maybe 3 times in the past decade. Honestly I don't need it and could easily live without it. I'd happily give mine up if it meant I'd never see innocent people get gunned down by one again.A gunman killed 35 people in Australia back in 1996. Less than 2 weeks later, Australia enacted sweeping gun-control measures.

There hasn't been a single mass shooting in Australia since.

We can stop this. We just don't want to. https://t.co/ZMWw7u47MsStill waiting for moment when ATTACKING someone else actually creates change, INSTEAD of DIVISIVENESS!
