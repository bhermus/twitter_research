you will never winA positive attitude will lead to positive outcomesSWS: Filipino happiness hits record high in December 2017 https://t.co/MKPVatoj6L"It's better to be feared than to be loved, if you cannot be both." -Machiavelli

To be feared is safer. People less likely hurt someone they fear compared to someone they love. And in a world full of hurts, to be safe is so much better.Work friends are a special breed of friends I swear they know every detail about your life and are so non-judgemental cos it’s like once your shift is over everything is forgotten until the next shift 😂😂 I bloody love itI think a big reason why we miss college so much is because there was an end to it. The end of a class, end of a lesson, end of a quiz, end of a subject, end of a semester, end of a year, end of college. After you graduate, it's just work and more work and, oh look, more work.."Why do people say "grow some balls"? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding." (Sheng Wang)
