bring me a cat
make her the softest that I'll ever pat
Give her a purr like a crackling fire
And tell her that I'll always sleep beside her

Don't have a kitten to call my own
Pull one from your magic hat

"There was never a time when me and Xepher were on bad terms, and we never spoke to each other either. I never received any direct damage from him, and I don't think it is right for him to be the topic of controversy just because he was a teammate at the time." (1)The Retribution event made me love Blackwatch https://t.co/dsbwKYOFjEThere’s a kid across the road who clearly plays Overwatch with his window open. You can hear him calling strats down the block. Thing is, he’s totally supportive and wholesome. “YOURE DOING GREAT REIN!” “YO TRACER THAT WAS SIIIICK”.

But then the photo was lost 😞 So for her birthday, I decided to recreate the scene in a drawing, and get her a brand new lipstick 💄💗 https://t.co/PymwmX8gSWIn the 1930s queer clubs &amp; spaces were vulnerable to police raids. Makeup was seen as a sign of effeminacy &amp; therefore homosexuality. Police would use blotting paper to test for powder &amp; rouge.
