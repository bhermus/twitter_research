Rt to make someone’s day! https://t.co/mOZrCSw0DnFor the Vice President to call someone held in contempt of court for unconstitutional racial profiling a “tireless champion” of the rule of law isn’t just a stretch, it’s an insult. https://t.co/yV2Y09XT51https://t.co/H4alUa96yOI attended the WHCD last night. Donald Trump has so poisoned the atmosphere by attacking the disabled, gold star parents, Muslims, Mexicans, Blacks, women, the press, the rule of law that a comedian who simply tells the truth is offensive? She’s joking.
