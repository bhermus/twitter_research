More red = higher percentage of long-term residents (&gt; 10 years).
More blue = lower percentage of long-term residents. https://t.co/cKRKDIjJGMLiterally none of this requires a blockchain, all of it is already possible, and the issues keeping touting alive are largely economic and business based not technological https://t.co/B2As0q6pV3 https://t.co/ctqKvFi95dGood morning. All research is political.

Tally by @electoralreform says almost 4,000 people were turned away yesterday from the 5 trial areas for voter ID. About 1.7% of the total turnout. That's a lot. They call it "a dark day for politics".Don‚Äôt go chasing waterfalls please stick to the fake-agile processes that you‚Äôre used to.I've been enjoying @DawnHFoster 's housing pieces in the Graun, but reading the comments gives me the rage.

This made me sad and meant I had to take new, worse screenshots.The value of registers scales directly with the degree to which people can trust them.

The interesting thing about registers compared to say, any stray bit of list on the internet is how that trust is engendered.Couldn‚Äôt vote yesterday (because I live in the wrong area), but made up for it today by voting for the new @OpenGovUK steering group members.

https://t.co/o2JFBzHAcYWhy do we keep thinking about data as if it has nothing to do with people? https://t.co/Qvhw0fYZ5XQuick thread! Keep reading things about why some feminists supposedly dislike Mumsnet, so I thought I'd try something - I looked for "Shon Faye" on the forum, spent about ten minutes scrolling, this is what I found:I'm Danny Dyer, and I'm about to meet Britain's most incomprehensible government employeesNone of the five boroughs taking part the ID trials has experienced a single instance of polling station impersonation in the past decade. https://t.co/1IMqtMQOlVSo, at this point, I'm free for new contracts from August '18.
