@ReadaBookSA https://t.co/VA3oOaWzivI don't drink coffee because;

- It has no nutritional benefits
- It dehydrates which could exposes you to all kinds of sicknesses 
- It stains your teeth

Caffeine is actually a drug that can stunt your growth (under 18's) I knew that as a child so I also never had caffeine.Our t-shirts &amp; caps are designed by @DitshegoMedia and printed/embroidered by black woman-owned company Melokuhle Holdings owned by Mrs Tidimalo Nkosi (left). I visited her firm in Midrand &amp; they do great work.

So while your father arrived here empty handed, a system which afforded his race privileges was already in place &amp; there's no doubt that it afforded him great advantages. https://t.co/FBm8Km6wwyGood response my leader! https://t.co/44pfmiRsh5They'll be quickest at the table when it's time to enjoy the fruits of victory. But when others were working the ground they would not move their hand an inch to lend a helping hand, as if these issues don't impact on their lives. https://t.co/MdXqLt0lc6The legendary Salif Keita from Mali, who wrote one of the greatest songs about Africa, which lifted the African spirit to new heights, has been in exile since 1978 because he was shunned by his own father for "bringing bad luck" &amp; his musical ambitions weren't supported at home. https://t.co/rBkeDAstMDIt is great to see how many people support the #AlbinismActivismCampaign and we look forward to seeing all South Africans standing together to make a powerful statement that will not only eliminate the stigma attached to albinism, but will also reverberate across the continent. https://t.co/rBkeDAK4EbWatch: Here's my challenge to you. #SowetoMarathon2018 https://t.co/Mj3WNOAt1mVery happy to see how many people have accepted the #SowetoMarathon2018 challenge, looking forward to seeing many others getting out of their comfort zones and joining us. 

I think reparing for a marathon is an effective way to encourage a healthy lifestyle and keeping fit. https://t.co/gjUWLg4fHTWe strive to know more today than we did yesterday, that's how we keep growing everyday. #IntellectualSwag.@Nontobek0Sibisi stood up against racism at .@eNCA.

This week she will be at CCMA to fight after she was unfairly dismissed .@IOL .@afroworldview .@floletoaba #RespekTheDoek@DitshegoMedia supports the #AlbinismActivismCampaign. Let's educate our communities that having little/no pigmentation doesn't make us less human. Belief systems that stereotype us based on our appearances blodgeon the very soul of our nation &amp; destroy the fabric of our society. https://t.co/pHa8lyFdzTUJ APK SRC will be having a dialogue next week Saturday on this.
