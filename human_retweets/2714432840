It depends on how you treat others.If you love her, never fill her ears with lies, her mouth with words, her eyes with tears, her mind with confusion and her heart with pain."You're sad? I'll cheer you up. You're upset? I'd love to listen. All you have to do is come to me, you know I'll be always there for you.!"Our days are easier when we give people a piece of our #heart rather than a piece of our #Mind ..This is it Chicago..
