End of March drop happened as we hear Sam is leaving (leaves mid-week) plus very male focused promotion. https://t.co/AxPOT7PFvA@RoyaleVision And Charlotte is the only carrying his X chromosome...

#JaSam #JaSamReunion2018 #JasamInSwitzerland #GH https://t.co/entJXtD6LqThis post was from March 23, 2018. A lot of promotion/focus was so male-centric that week and after.  No surprise that the ratings for the following week show #GH losing that #1 spot in the key demographic Women Viewers 18-49 spot. 😕 @valentinifrank @nathanvarni @ABC_Publicity https://t.co/8BH4DYqagYThe plot thickens today on #YR! https://t.co/OGP0HjZ0tsHarrison Chase #GH https://t.co/hxk7zNTZOKSam with kids today #GH https://t.co/rACgsEnvU7Missing General Hospital’s Sam McCall/Morgan, so binge watched some Jessica Jones this weekend.  Can’t wait to watch Sam in action this week! #SamFF #Jasam #GH #JessicaJones https://t.co/V6iE8C1AjNThinking about Barbara Bush’s legacy of service to our country and the extraordinary family she raised. Thanking her for her many kindnesses to me and my family. Wishing her the comfort she deserves surrounded by her loved ones.Andrew Scheer is now reading a prepared statement attacking the prime minister without knowing the outcome of the meeting or knowing the details on specific measures the PM will outline in less than an hour.Andrew Scheer on News world right now. Amazing. Everything he said was completely wrong 😀.Andrew Scheer? Was he in the meetings?? Nope.Anna should let Robert sleep on the couch in her suite tonight.  No doubt much hilarity will ensue!

#GH #RnASam:  “Hello, this is Special Agent Anna Devane, WSB ...”

Our first hint of the Anna, Sam, Jason connection! (I guess Drew was no more Jason than Sam was Anna, though.) Still it was fun!

Excited for adventures of real Anna, Jason &amp; Sam - with Robert &amp; kids too. 

#GH #Jasam https://t.co/NUvInZvxDXIt’s a long shot, but I’m hoping for a scene with Sam and Emma while they’re in Switzerland. I miss them #gh https://t.co/wBXpL0SKm4#GH loved Anna's reaction to Robert! Classic comedy😁So ready for Jason, Sam, Anna, and Robert teaming up together. #GHOMG THOSE FLOPPY EARS https://t.co/TsljQ1lCbuExcited that these three will be spending time together again . I’ve missed that #JaSam #Spinelli https://t.co/Azfb8IPcATSo the first time we see Sam back onscreen in over 2 weeks is when Jason runs into her in Switzerland. 

And the first time Sam returns to the PH, I’m sure she will be returning with Jason, Danny and Scout 🙃☺️❤️ I love it! #GH #JaSam #JaSamReunion2018 #JaSamily https://t.co/Zx5Uitos91Just curious #GH tweeps, to which generational group do you belong?This really is the ultimate #GH  power line up ... it’s bound to push up ratings set the show up for a good May sweeps period.

#GH #Stelly https://t.co/tvIYitce8kI’m thinking Sam, Danny and Scout we’re enjoying some relaxing time and Disneyland this evening prompting Sam to recall her recent “once upon a time” magical moment with Jason as they read a fairytale to Danny... #GH #Jasam  ❤️💫 https://t.co/kwjt4FX62NI’m going through Sam withdrawal.  I’m going to need Kelly Monaco &amp; Sam back on #GH pronto.  (I hope Sam doesn’t need too many days to think.) 

#SamFF #Jasam https://t.co/6sBaTO1ClhI love Joss. She is Carly reincarnate. #GHSharon to Victoria: "Don't ever center your whole life around a man. I've done it plenty of times, and you know what? You lose yourself, you forget who you are!"

#JaSamReunion2018 #Jasam https://t.co/Cb1TZ1Cw0MWhat the heck was going on with Franco’s hair during that fight scene? #GH #Friz https://t.co/HQTnDiX18kI see Frank tweeted since my comment yesterday which in addition to Jason and Sonny does mention Carly, so the male:female ratio in Frank’s tweet mentions gets updated to 11:3 - I guess a slight improvement from 9:2 ... still hoping to see more balance overall ...  🤷🏻‍♀️ #GH https://t.co/0eyR2760Vj@valentinifrank @EviganGreg @GeneralHospital Good stories in many ways, but look at your last 8 tweets Frank. Consider the ratio of mentions of male characters/actors to female ones: 
Jim, Drew, Jake, Max, Oscar, Joss, Anna, Jason, Franco, Peter, Finn ... 9:2 - male to female.  What does that tell you? #GH @ABCPublicity https://t.co/3IK7TDV6j5What do you think about the gender balance of significant good storylines/dialogue on #GH?@kellymonaco1 @1SteveBurton The Winning Team!

#PCPDBeginnings https://t.co/yps70g2ExqI just loved these scenes with Sam and Alexis. Sometimes a mom’s love is everything (even if you don’t always agree with each and every one of her opinions). Awesome! #GH #Samlexis 🙌🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/RhroblIcANI can’t wait for this now... 🙌🏼💫

#GH #Jasam #Sam #Jason https://t.co/31aAxGh6LFSoaps in Depth #GH 55th Anniversary cover this month ...just a wee bit testosterone heavy!

Just curious.Fun @GeneralHospital audition story from @1SteveBurton #GH55 https://t.co/fpWr33MAsnSteve basically said we about to watch Sam and Jason start over and fall back in love all over again. That’s what made people fall in love with JaSam. Those elements of special moments and slow build. Steve seems excited! ☺️❤️🙌🏼🙏🏼🙃 #GH #JaSam #JaSamReunion2018 https://t.co/doVOwgpTl7@JaSamHive https://t.co/d2H0x9P11M#GH Sam and Liz be like https://t.co/L6rFFivK3uSam tossed Drews wedding ring to Liz like it was a hot potato 🥔....☕️😂😂 #Gh #jasamGreat numbers #GH !

Keep giving us the good stuff.  #JaSamReunion2018 https://t.co/b0Qt5JmFWx@Jaime_A_Sommers And of course Sam is Cat Woman! I want her in the action with Jason and Anna eventually.

#GHThank you for my beautiful birthday gift!! And in return, here is Josh on my monitor!! I am grateful to you all xo #yr https://t.co/G2h885RULrThe ratings pre earthquake and before #Jasam starting to reunite with their “I love be you” moments weren’t great.  It was frustrating to watch the show and even I wasn’t getting around to watching, but this tectonic shift to #Jasam love should boost ratings now - loving #GH now! https://t.co/tt4U0nmLJZWho would you like to see turn out to be Francesca’s mother?

#GH

1. Sam being clandestine about Jason (the kiss, her feelings)

2. Sam at the Q.’s telling Jason they should do something fun since Drew wasn’t there

3. Constant refs to Drew as Sam’s husband while #Jasam romance buildsWATCH: Sam finally goes there with Jason. #GH https://t.co/ZEA1uZEpW5@EsquireT7 He jumps throw the skylight to save her, and now they jump hand in hand. Goodness, this couple is everything.Jason has a flashback of Sam's ILY's.
