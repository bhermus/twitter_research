We bury each other well. Imagine that kind of support when one of our own starts a business, opens a school, launches a clothing line, drops a record, needs money to graduate, has medical bills to pay etc. We show up when it's too late.Kelly Khumalo sings a song for Akhumzi Jezile

#BBNaijaAnger is short madness, it steals your energy and keeps you away from luv. The best answer to anger is silence. So forgive you will grow beyond what you are. # Anger never helps to solve a problem. It destroys our peace of mind and blinds our ability to think clearly #rico-vation https://t.co/bdiEFWXJ2hUnity is strength 😍

#BBNaijaTrust me, had Tobi and Cee-C clicked, they would have been the biggest ship to ever sail in #BBNaija history.

Y'all think your ships were cute? LOL 
You have no idea how well Tobo G can spoil a woman.Tobi has a heart of gold and your Queen would have shone like a diamond had she disregarded her "bad bitch" strategy and let love win.

For the umpteenth time, I never hated your Queen, I just didn't like her making Tobi look bad!

E Go Be ✌🏽️ #BBNaijaDear Lashes FC,

I never hated your King/Queen!!

Tobi kept losing fans because of her and I only aired my frustration through banter, not by attacking or insulting her.

It's just sad y'all have no sense of humour 🤦🏾‍♂️
