I think that was my favourite moment with the Twins  #canucksBurr: One of my favourite memories was when Hank was chasing the Art Ross. Going into the last game, OV had scored a couple goals and was two points ahead. The Twins didn't mention anything, but I knew they wanted that title for Hank, and we did too.The @Canucks fans cheer "GO SEDINS GO!"

You are two of the classiest people I've ever met. You have meant so much to this team, this community and to Canucks fans everywhere. Next stop, the Hall of Fame. https://t.co/lmNsRm9fVsIt‚Äôs never been about the headlines for Daniel and Henrik, it‚Äôs been about doing what‚Äôs right.

You don‚Äôt hunt with that gun, you don‚Äôt defend yourself with that gun. It is a gun used to kill and it wrecked havoc on my entire community.

It was about guns. You weren't there, you don't know how it felt. Guns give these disgusting people the ability to kill other human beings.

The only way to enact sane gun regs is at the ballot box. If you feel that way, it's simple: if they take money from the NRA, don't vote for 'em in November.Politicians: Limiting access to guns won‚Äôt keep you safe.

If you‚Äôre not excited about it, please disregard that exclamation point."If we ban guns they will just find another way." 

Then let them find another way. Let them try to kill dozens in a matter of minutes with a goddamn butter knife. Let them hurl stones. Let's force mass murders to get creative as hell.
