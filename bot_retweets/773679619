It's a question of right or wrong.The most corrupt WH in US history. A president who lies every time he opens his mouth. A president who abuses women, spews racism and refuses to protect US from enemy attacks. What else has to happen for GOP to stand up to this immoral schmuck?Jared Kushner‚Äôs security clearance has been downgraded from ‚Äútop-secret‚Äù to ‚Äúsecret.‚Äù I‚Äôll hold my applause until Jared Kushner‚Äôs position has been downgraded from ‚ÄúWhite House Senior Adviser‚Äù to ‚ÄúFederal Prison Inmate.‚Äù #TrumpCrimeFamilyThis degree of arrogance is unfathomable. Condemning Carson for it and saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Fired!‚Äù should be easy. It‚Äôs not exactly . . . well, brain surgery.

PLEASE RETWEET THIS LIST so that we can stop reading think-pieces in which Trump allies‚Äîor journos who don't follow the Trump-Russia story‚Äîsagely advise us that America has absolutely *no* evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. https://t.co/i6SnPIydZVEarlier today, Paul Ryan said House Republicans would focus on law enforcement failures, not stronger gun laws, after the mass school shooting in Parkland. 

Ryan is a top Congressional recipient of @NRA money. https://t.co/opPorOIOYvJeff Sessions has today announced that he is opening an investigation into FISA abuses in the 2016 election.

In other words Trump is using his Justice Department to go after his political enemies by first creating a conspiracy theory, and then having his DOJ act on that theory..@Patbagley knows what‚Äôs up: https://t.co/wg3sAtqQRN https://t.co/SN02zLJE9fMarco Rubio sinks to lowest approval rating ever after defending his NRA pals https://t.co/fo9ZerasUeBig investors have made huge profits from the sale of weapons like the AR-15 rifle used at #MSD. But they‚Äôve done next to nothing to stop gun violence.

#NeverAgain #BanAssaultWeaponsRun for Something has placed a full-page ad in the Sun Sentinel ‚Äî the main newspaper in Broward County ‚Äî to encourage young people to run against the 25 unopposed Florida state legislators who are backed by the NRA. The ad says: ‚ÄúTHE NRA IS KILLING OUR KIDS.‚Äú (via @playbookplus) https://t.co/2rVFG3e78HSince Trump's election, the democrats have flipped 39 seats. Republicans have flipped 4. 

RT if you're ready for @SpeakerRyan's retirement.Through their pain, the students from Parkland have been demanding lawmakers take action to make sure an AR-15 can never be used to perpetrate another mass shooting. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm calling for a Judiciary Committee hearing on our bill to #BanAssaultWeapons.It's very simple: no clearance, no briefings. It‚Äôs time for White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to enforce the rules and obey our laws.
