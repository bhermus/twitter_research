https://t.co/oME8MRrLDf https://t.co/1pK7cy8ZDmI realize that threats like "we'll take away prom and suspend you if you march" would have stopped me from doing so as a teen. But as an adult, I can assure you -- high school comes to an end. Gun violence won't, unless we make it. #CherryHillThe administration of Cherry Hill East High School is in gross violation of the First Amendment and has censored and is censoring our teachers.
