#HayeBellew2 https://t.co/n53t3b8LNpThe reason a lot of people are frustrated in life is because they focus too much on “success”. So they do all that they were told to do to be successful and end up not successful. This leads to real frustration. My strategy is, just enjoy the struggles of life with a smile.Next Rated Award Winners at The #Headies #12thHeadies ;

#Headies2018Hello @iam_Davido. My name is Ibrahim Dankwambo, Governor of Gombe state. I’m a huge fan of your amazing work and talent. I’d be glad if you can use your massive influence to work together with me in convincing our young people to go get their #PVC. 
Do I have your assurance?Just enjoy the music you make. Get lost in it. Play that sh*t back in the whip 1,000 times with the windows down. Then make more 💨💨💨💨God knows I’m trying ...When my school discovered I was undocumented, my scholarship &amp; in-state tuition were taken away. I told my papi that I was going to drop out &amp; work instead. My papi told me he’d cut his arm off before I dropped out.  We made it work.
