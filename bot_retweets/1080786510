#ThereIsNoExcuseForAnimalAbuse https://t.co/1EgKGqzOBtOn June 18th, 1964, Martin Luther King Jr. was placed into a police car in St. Augustine, Florida. A German shepherd police dog was put in the car with him in an apparent attempt to intimidate Mr. King. Instead, King and the dog promptly became friends! 🙏💛🐕 -Martin Luther King https://t.co/Lgdq4PtrazPlease sign and share this important petition, urging Michael Conway to support and Co-sponsor H.R. 1406, The Dog and Cat Meat Prohibition Act

Free orcas don’t always “put on a show”, when they do, it’s because they *choose* to without any food motivation or fear. by Bob Fraumeni off Race Rocks in Canada." 🐳💙 https://t.co/YXyFt3G6oQWhat is the meaning of the Spanish word 'GILIPOLLAS'? 

Arsehole, Ass, Asshole, Dickhead, Douchebag, Shithead, Wanker etc.

Quite apt for this POS!!

Hunters are cowards.

https://t.co/DPVmDnThS9It's so unfair that NYCACC set pets on deathrow in those dangerous days :-( how will they have a fair chance being adopted or rescued?

Otitis helped her heal and made her happier than she ever thought possible 💕 https://t.co/KY9j8GZySy"I went out to feed the village dogs.

We will try to keep Leo as comfortable as possible and he will not be on his own now, unlike the months he spent alone waiting for his so called human to return 😥😥 https://t.co/S2Cj3LKzG4Humans are egg doomed species. To kill a mother and her babies! We are seeing this far too much across the United States. I say put the dumping owners to sleep. https://t.co/e9R8jESbAwLeo is very critical, he is not maintaining his temperature, also refusing to take any food. Vets have us that he is not responding at all now. We are praying for a miracle as surely after all he's been through he so deserves love and care 💕💕 https://t.co/CaLaTdD6dHWe have had nobody contact us so far if you know of a rescue who you believe could be of  some help please let us know https://t.co/VJMzaOtblS#WednesdayMotivation
