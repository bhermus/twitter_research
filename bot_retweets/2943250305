California is suing for it, we ain't having this sh*t go down like that.#NetNeutrality 

THINGS YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW:

🔘Call 202-759-7766
🔘OR Text "BATTLE" to 384-387
🔘Tell everyone you know to do that

This decision on #NetNeutrality still needs to be taken to court!We’re disappointed in the decision to gut #NetNeutrality protections that ushered in an unprecedented era of innovation, creativity &amp; civic engagement. This is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix stands w/ innovators, large &amp; small, to oppose this misguided FCC order.Update 1.8 releases tomorrow. Are you ready?
