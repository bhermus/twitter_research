Would love to have a cup of coffee!Why do we spend our lives striving to be something that we would never want to be if only we knew what we wanted?

Editor John D. Caputo,‚ÄúWe can only live changes: we cannot think our way to humanity. Every one of us, every group, must become the model of that which we desire to create.‚Äù IllichSchool at its worst curates a curriculum around amnesia, whereby a virtue is made of forgetting the family, in preparation for ‚Äòthe factory‚Äô. Here the factory is an analogy 4 the marketplace. All true learning must begin, therefore, by remembering our origin stories/our culture.@welovelb Happy Easter one and all! BW Cormac #ABCD@welovelb Love seeing front yards covered with colored eggs and kids laughing! #abcd #welovelb #communityThe juxtaposition between vengeance and hospitality is telling. Vengeance is a practice that perceives others as threat or competitor or rival; the opposite is hospitality that sees the other as guest. -Walter Brueggemann
