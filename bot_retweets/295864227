From “come over” to “come home” is a real relationship Goal for me.."i have late night conversations with the moon. she tells me about the sun, and i tell her about you"Don't waste 4 years of highschool calling urself fat because ur probably v skinny and then suddenly ur in college and ur actually kinda fatPeople who buy pants online are the bravest people out thereYall ever be laying w/ somebody and try to breathe like them and almost die?for the record, I am extremely sensitive and any absence of my sensitivity is only a coping mechanism to ease the frequent pain and embarrassment of my sensitivityhttps://t.co/h4KLnZGb7J“I heard....” 
I don’t give a fuck. 
I know what the fuck I’m doing.i'm excited for the future professors emerging from our generation. they're probably going to be so chill and open-minded, and their classes will be so relevant and entertaining. I probs won't experience them, but I honestly look forward to the millennial faculty hahajust because you didn't appreciate something then it doesn't mean that you can't appreciate it now. It's part of growing upIf you can't appreciate Spanish music I don't appreciate youdate a girl who's cute af but can also eat a whole pizza by herselfI think the definition of self worth is:

knowing someone is saying something completely false about you

and not even caring enough to try to convince them otherwise, because you know what happened and you know who you are.https://t.co/SrupZDay6Pi swear when i'm in a relationship i'll drop $70 on u like its nothing but then debate on whether i wanna buy myself dinner or not lmaoas a society we need to accept that when someone asks you to take a photo what they mean is take 25 photos from various anglesshoutout to all the ppl who get anxiety about getting dressed up for things like formals or nicer events or just getting dressed in general. i feeeeel you 🙌🏼So many thoughts rushing through my head, so many questions I haven't answered yetWhen I'm quiet: 

1) tired 

2) don't have anything to talk about 

3) over-thinking 

4) upset 

5) falling apart 

6) all of the abovehave you ever been so wildly attracted to someone that you can actually feel it driving you crazy“Daaam you reply quick you bored?”

First of all I am in love with you ..why is being alive so expensive. im not even having a good time.Insecurity kills all that is beautiful.not to be a soft bitch but... literally everything hurts my feelings.I have words that I purposefully avoid typing bc I’m not sure how to spell them. ie: nauseousdo u ever look at someone and just pray to god you never lose themDo you ever look back on a time in your life and think "thank fuck I'm not like that anymore!" Growth is great! 👍🏼I really have no limits to how terrible I'm willing to look in public.having a job is cool and all until you gotta get up and go 😂😂Zendaya is me when it comes to doing anything in life https://t.co/Ff2etOQZztThat sigh of relief when you drop your phone and pick it up to no cracked screen 😅 #closecall #nopunintended https://t.co/FaA2yDwPiEthis makes me happy https://t.co/pbzThmAVPGhttps://t.co/kjcToSrOMrhere is my entire “A Story Like Mine” poem from today’s #WomensMarch2018 in NYC tw: rape / assault.

Skin: ah ok mija here's a cute lil breakoutEveryday I am learning that I know nothing. And in my quest to know all I can attain in this life, I find there is nothing to know at all but to be.I hate it when you get cat fished by a parking spot. You think you've found an empty spot, but then BOOM NOPE you see a friggen fiat or something.Thick skin is attractive. If someone says something negative, who cares? brush it off. If something embarrassing, I'll be funny later. Learn to laugh at yourself so they laugh w/ you not at you &amp; most importantly, don't take things too seriously. Life is better like that.https://t.co/PKjMUPfcWLAyeeee that name drop is fire ! Love you Ethan ! https://t.co/7Dd925NP2q
