📰🎧 | Former AFL goal umpire Luke Walker joined The 5th Quarter yesterday to tell tales from his illustrious career, including shedding some light on THAT point in the drawn 2010 grand final.

READ + LISTEN to his interview on yesterday's show HERE: https://t.co/4qMxRow80x https://t.co/KrWm0nxN2gThe @sandyzebs injury list starts in the front office: its impressive new CEO David Cannizzo is nursing a broken hand after having a run with South Yarra in the Southern    league. Played as a ‘decoy’ forward, kicked 3.4  - and damaged a mitt as he did a Dusty fend-off.A $10 million fine for Telstra for overcharging. Good.
How much for blatant petrol price fixing and grotesque profiteering?
