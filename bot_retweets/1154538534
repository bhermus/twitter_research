Trump asked if there were any “Hispanics” in the room and the crowd BOOED. 

He then used YOUR support to justify this naked racism.

THIS is why there was nothing original or edgy about your support of Trump.

All you did was empower racists. https://t.co/dL08s2r6J7President says he has secret information on Senator which could destroy him. Press ignores. Comedian tells rude jokes. Press has a freak-out.
