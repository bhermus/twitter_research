In all honesty I would like to know than why the UN is not requesting the wealthy Middle East Countries to take in more of their own, and help them vs US and other countries getting over run with more violence, immigrants and poverty. https://t.co/4koAtlLdhshttps://t.co/InGIt1Bgg2 The Bangladesh-Myanmar governmental agreement on the repatriation of Rohingya bothers me to the core of my soul. It should to everyone.#Bangladesh under no circumstances shall you involve the military in this the Rohingya Crisis. There will be conflicts but refugees must not see any berets. Even under @albd1971 and its missteps the civilian govt.is in-charge. My beloved followers, get ready for a showdown. https://t.co/jPtp7TysEZ#Rohingya this makes sense. Among the overwhelmingly large number of children, some became orphans first through the heart-wrenching #InvoluntarySeparation and then by #Martyrdom of their parents in the hands of @OfficialSuuKyi #mercenaries. #IntolerablySad #Bangladesh #StandUp https://t.co/VFCzwaZVVb#BecauseOFHim Why is this tweet even a news. There had been hundreds of instances like the one mentioned in Utah Outcasts' tweet.  If anything why did overwhelming majority of ""Christians, in UT, touting "Family Values vote for Trump?"" https://t.co/3kBv9xzjH6Why don't you ask International community to give money to #Bangladesh, Mr. Activist?
Why don't just go to Myanmar and ask @OfficialSuuKyi to give money for their better - the #Rohingyas - housing? https://t.co/YX7DBFeiO7I will work with you but I am not going to divulge names, You do the same please. But remember in your #Maynmar a Genocidal beast is  wounded but still in power. In mine #Bangladesh #Trumpina aka Hasina gov.t in power. WE know the beasts. Stay tuned and let's work together. #300. https://t.co/u6jxqun08z@LtMohab @Rare_Eli No, I am correct in saying, "two evils don't a good make." I thank you for your politeness in your efforts of correcting me; and I do acknowledging many instances of omissions and commissions of errors in my tweets - but the one you are alluding to, is correct. #EnglishWriting#Bangladesh is honored to have papal vist. I ask the pope to kindly  provide all kind of material support through International bodies such as U.N. Red cross etc. Vatican is endowed amptly. Country is looking for his spiritual guidance and healing EVEN MORE IN CRISIS. We pray. https://t.co/ipXwFW8ERKYou just made "case in point of premise of my tweet." It makes all  the more of a reason that more money needs to be given the country to take care of nearly 1m refugees. Please do some research about #Bangladesh. It is now the 36 in the world in purchasing power. @syeddoha https://t.co/7GRpjx9SOX#Bangladesh PM with devils horns in the image (@guardian I am okay even it is your mischief). She has resorted to Trump's play book with False Claims thus essentially #pleadingGuilty as charged. Heneforth I will call her Trumpina Devilazed. Heard,#BD ?https://t.co/TuNQLAtF8r#Bangladesh how miraculously the PM under @albd1971 appears to have horns? Do you see that? That's not a conincidence. I am for friendship with our superpower neighbor but Sheikh Hasina is totally selling out the country to India an vanquishing any opposition by #VanishingThem. https://t.co/KEt5NvrCMT#Bangladesh Guardian (one of a few that I follow) and particularly @davidbangladesh for writing this piece. I was not gonna touch it because of the Rohingya crisis. David, please stay on it. Bangladesh PM may have been part of political oppression and even criminal activities.I meant to say "no where near being Elated."
I humbly say that I am aware of the NEED for healthy challenges by the people who fought for Rohingyas - make it vigorous but I will not accept any anti-American or any tinge of anti-Semitism. #Bangladesh I am proud of you. So is NYC. https://t.co/LcFgiMvXNy#Bangladesh if this is the deal then I am much relieved but no where closed to be my own listening ears tells that Myanmar is little surprised by the noise that broke out but very surprised by @StateDept. I made my own diplomatic round in NYC. #Repatriation must be voluntary. https://t.co/IHbOd6bclD#Bangladesh The sentimate shift towards the displaced minorities from Myanmar among the NYC &amp; Financial elites ( yes, I am no Gandhi, so I have no qualm about that) is extremely encouraging. I may decide to deliver a live video speech myself but for tonight, I will be quiet.#BANGLADESH Has the grinning Foreign Minister of @albd1971 Govt. had any discussions with Finance Minstry? There is no way to evacuate completely displaced 1m people in short order, the monsoon season is coming. The housing will simply be washed way. YOU NEED TO PLAN THIS, NOW.#AudacityOfLexicon Unlike Mahatma Gandhi, whose Times Magazine photo placed right under that of our Savior - I wake up to every morning - I'm not fighting against an Empire that was British Empire, I am fighting against #Injustice. Fights hurt. But #Bangladesh  must for #Justice. https://t.co/PluIgIjNbO#AudacityOfLexicon It's not the Magnitude of the #Rohingya crisis, It is not the attitude we've; It is the Latitude we take #BANGLADESH, to remain silent as hundreds of thousands children become the #SilenceOfLambs. Go on with your #SilenceOfDems, Humanity. https://t.co/9wlmeymFN4This is the one I was #deadwrong and 31k+ people read it. If I was wrong, so wwas Hamilton &amp; #ECmajority, then. Mr. Trump’s “Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of Tweet Popularity.” by Syed Doha https://t.co/ZQZVvKZykIIt is hard to reconcile with the fact that this happened during MY lifetime &amp; I consider myself done with my life but we are back where we were in this God's land. It's the first social networking message that I wrote w/out much thought. I want to be servant of  #InjusticeWatch . https://t.co/lLtybmb4mn#InjusticeWatch as you probably know I am fighting the biggest battle of my life and will not back down fighting for #StateLess #Rohingyas. You know I am a LDS, so is @dohaLaura but we fight for justice ever so buoyed by your relentless fight. Keep up the good work. See you soon. https://t.co/n6YaSmnL7x#MYANMAR hear that. Sheikh Hasina, do you hear that? DO NOT talk repatriation. Then go back and visit all the countries you possibly can and ask for money to #Rehabilitate the people that fled persecution - Ask  @OfficialSuuKyi to start depositing repatriation money right now. https://t.co/9eLyGLHgFRIf I hear one more thing about the plight of #MuslimsInME from the #ARABIANA I will shoot it down like I am gone #DuckHunting in #MossyOak (MossyOak should pay me for this tweet) #camoflague gear and sitting high-up on a tree as bunch of #Geese flying past me.  #FaceUpSaudiArabiaHow engaged are my beloved followers? Don't count the RT? How about Impressions? Not the yellow ones just plain simple blue organic impressions? Over
1.6 million in 24 hours, people. That's how we do it simply in #DAWTSINC https://t.co/FdjagTJob2#WhichCEO goes through sports training before bringing out his fabulously #TeeedUp company. This CEO of #Dawts does. This devil reality #WearsPrada https://t.co/s1BLsnT8On#Dawts and #DohaLaptops will be bundled together and priced as #SerpentsToorh but that's good news, isn't it #TrueThat. See how hard is #GospelTruth? https://t.co/qSIN5ySjLE#Rohngyas Those children are criminals? I hope you are not a father. I am just yours just because your tweet is pure gold corroborating my position to #Rehabilitate the #Rohingyas in #Bangladesh. https://t.co/VavLnf1DgC#Dawts has 35 lives so, it is here to stay. But this is the beginning of the end of TV Sets as you know it. I know the vampires. You, Sir, are no #vampire https://t.co/Imxc2E3qIR#SDOHA I give up on my desire. But, oh, when did I become the #Vampire? (Courtesy: Little Club) https://t.co/WVbRGvqBS5#BANGLADESH You need money. Now, if you're as @albd1971 saying how solvent you are and how capable you are then the world won't give you money. So for heaven's sake take down these campaign tweets. These are unnecessary for the current situation. https://t.co/dGYcb0QK6vNew page :) https://t.co/3jgdtG1F24
