Wow. Green explodes for six runs in the inning off of base knocks from Mason Barber and Hayden Whitis along with a pair of hit by pitches.

Green is three outs away from a win and an SOC I Championship and a possible perfect game!Bottom 3rd

Outstanding start for the Bobcats. Tanner Kimbler has 4 K's and hasn't allowed a hit yet, Tayte Carver, Bryce Ponn and Mason Barber have all driven in a run each.

Carver made a sensational play at short to preserve his buddy's no-hitter so far.FINAL/5
