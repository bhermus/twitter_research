Those are the essentials.God calls us to love others by encouraging and building each other up.Forgiven people forgive.Our bond with others in Christ should be stronger than our relationship to other members of our own racial and national groups.One simple way to avoid gossip: When you talk about someone behind their back, leave your listener with a higher view of that person.Heaven rules. Earth never has the last word.“I can tell how much God you have by how much entertainment you need.” AW TozerGodly friends will wound us for our good.

It must grieve the Holy Ghost when His dramatic Word is recited dispassionately. The preacher doesn’t make the gospel dramatic-it already is.” R.C. SproulFaith doesn’t make sense. It makes miracles.Don’t get drunk on productivity and entertainment and neglect the most important thing you need to do today: pray."Be hard on yourself and easy on others.

Prov 20:15Piper: “God, don’t let me just see your beauty and enjoy your beauty. Let me be changed into that beauty.”Listen as @RCSproul considers why the early church was bold in its proclamation of the gospel. https://t.co/6jfe9KlDt9Nothing you do could earn God’s love. Nothing you do could lose God’s love. He saves us by grace alone.I'm a Christian. I'm not perfect. Just because I mess up sometimes doesn't mean I'm fake. There's no such thing as a perfect Christian."To preach the gospel is nothing else than Christ's coming to us or bringing us to him." Martin LutherAll Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable…that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17).The news is still depressing.
God is still good tho!There’s no virtue in having a Bible sit unread on a shelf or a Bible app remain unused on your phone. A closed Bible does no good.“Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.” Pro. 13:20 Companionship = untroubled togetherness.No greater treasure can be conceived than the Son of God--and all that God is for us in him."I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."

-AW TozerDo not waste time bothering whether you “love” your neighbor; act as if you did.
C. S. LewisThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. May today be a day of get-to in a week of have-to. Delight in worship and rest.It is the whole business of the whole church to preach the whole gospel to the whole world.Religion: My identity is built on being a good person. 
Gospel: My identity is not built on my record or my performance but on Christ's.Prayer is not optional for the Christian; it is required. —@RCSproulGrace will make you feel weaker than you've ever felt before, while it blesses you with infinitely more power than you've ever known.Two dangers of social media: (1) overly praising your work and (2) regularly pointing out the errors of others. Both shrivel the soul.“We must be as resolute to cast our care upon the Lord as to confess our sins to him.” -F. B. MeyerGrace will confront you with your guilt, while it blesses you with complete and forever forgiveness.To stand still is nothing to be ashamed of, if you happen to be standing in the right place.A meaningful life is finding and valuing the beauty of God. Once found, we will inevitably respond and give back to Him.“Godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of the world.” 1 Timothy 6:6"Prayer is an acknowledgment that our need of God’s help is not partial but total"

Faith is the instrument by which grace flows to us.God’s grace is sufficient for us anywhere His providence places us.I have noticed in my life that when I seek Jesus above everything else, that I no longer need to seek everything else.I'm starting to believe today's Christianity is more cultural in its appearance and jargon than it is actually following Jesus in character.The first thing you need to know, and maybe the last thing you need to know as well, is who you are in Christ.“Trust the past to the mercy of God, the present to His love, and the future to His providence.” –AugustineIf you’re really saved, it is because at some point in your life you heard the voice of God calling, and you responded.God unto whom all hearts are open and all desires known, cleanse the thoughts of our hearts that we may perfectly love thee -T. CranmerDon’t let your Bible be hidden or dusty. Begin today to let God revive you according to His Word.One of the last acceptable idolatries among middle class Christians is the idolatry of the family.God doesn’t always heal us or give us what we want.
