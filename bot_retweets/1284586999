Wolf just pointed out that both women lie shamelessly and continuously on behalf of Donald Trump, which is contemptible and  horrifying.Their outrage is phony and selective. After what they‚Äôve condoned, they‚Äôve lost the right to be outraged forever. 

They‚Äôre offended by comedy? I‚Äôm offended by reality. https://t.co/f6Jg0dr8OlWhile everyone clutched their pearls over rough punchlines at the #WHCD, Trump:

*oops* https://t.co/mWkhh7XLtzI attended the WHCD last night. Donald Trump has so poisoned the atmosphere by attacking the disabled, gold star parents, Muslims, Mexicans, Blacks, women, the press, the rule of law that a comedian who simply tells the truth is offensive?
