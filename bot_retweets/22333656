She debuted alongside the Man of Steel in Action Comics #1 way back in 1938, and was standing up for herself from the very beginning. https://t.co/rMDSROa3So@DCComics 5 years ago you did a far better job at celebrating Superman's anniversary, because surprisingly you haven't forgot about Lois Lane and gave her an entire anniversary book, even though you were running New 52 that pathetically treated this iconic female character. https://t.co/aW5nKCh49dThank you Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster for creating Superman and making the world a brighter place. #happy80th #superman #westandontheshouldersofgiants #action1000 #actioncomics #dccomics https://t.co/WPcqo0PU91For 80 years of Truth, Justice and Endless Inspiration.

Lois was subtly references as Superman's world back in MoS. When Jor-El points to Earth, we see the planet first, pod is not explicitly noticable, but Kal spots Lois immediately while looking at the world.
#BvSReferences https://t.co/0KVU8llEv4This kind of distant silent mental conversations between Superman and Lois Lane is best thing ever. Visual storytelling at its finest. https://t.co/no3JJaAKFXOur gallery was updated with screen captures of @justiceleaguewb 
https://t.co/gojStFQUNJ #AmyAdams https://t.co/gPkAFBQ3HKRemember the time when Lois Lane was front and center at Man of Steel promo pictures? "There are heroes among us, not to make us feel smaller, to remind us what makes us great". https://t.co/MNVDO5wYLtIn both scenes, Superman is at his lowest point &amp; Lois is there for him

BvS-Lois reminds him how important his symbol is while Lex tears it down

STAS-Lois comforts Clark as after he was brainwashed by Darkseid &amp; lost the trust of humanity. The final scene of the final episode.. https://t.co/ofBbCDhdLTIn MoS, the guy Lois Lane fell in love was not Superman, It's a farmer boy who will never quit helping ppl for his own sake. 
BVS, their relationship stabled, they became equal partners both in life and works. 
MOS&amp;BVS. Clois make sense to me 4 the 1st time. in a live-action film https://t.co/81BCDFeWDcToday is the 2 Year Anniversary of #BatmanvSuperman. BvS is simply one of the most powerful comic book films ever made &amp; by far the most beautiful comic book film of all time.

This film had an unquestionable impact on the medium &amp; is still discussed everyday!
