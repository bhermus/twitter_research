Here are some others: https://t.co/WpWMl2Wd75 #SmallBusinessWeek@SCOREMentors The trend of resume masking greatly helps in removing the #implicitbias that may influence hiring decisions #smallbusinessweek@SBAgov A8: Visit your local @sbagov, @scorementors, @ASBDC, and other small business resource centers. You can always find great tips and advice at https://t.co/iv85ooPI1y #SmallBusinessWeekGreat tips coming out during the #SmallBusinessWeek chat with @SBAgov, @SCOREMentors, @ConstantContact and many other great organizations! Follow along! https://t.co/u4Ui3h0ZUNA8 (1/3) ‚Äì There are so many great resources available to small businesses. If you‚Äôre looking for a great mentor, look no further than @SCOREMentors. @SBAgov #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/ZB9D45gLNy@SBAgov @SmBizDaily, @smallbiztrends, and @SCOREMentors are great accounts to follow on Twitter.@SBAgov A7: Have a strong &amp; personal company mission‚Äîthat way your employees know you stand behind your business! We're also big fans of social events like trivia, karaoke, restaurant visits &amp; happy hours to give your employees some free time to get to know each other! #SmallBusinessWeek@SBAgov A7: You‚Äôre more likely to retain employees that feel empowered. Get employees involved in solving your company‚Äôs most challenging problems, and give them the autonomy to take action. #SmallBusinessWeek@SCOREMentors Absolutely! And while #socialmedia is still very important, with all the changes to algorithms in the last few years you need to make sure your business controls the digital access to your audience/followers/subscribers as much as possible. #SmallBusinessWeekA7: Create a company culture of treating employees as assets rather than expenses.  #smallbusinessweek@SBAgov A7: It‚Äôs important to put ample time into developing an effective job description, in which you paint a clear picture of the qualifications of the position. Clear job descriptions can help you attract great candidates. #SmallBusinessWeeka7 We wrote about perks for retaining employees here: https://t.co/lxyPsRlSyB #smallbusinessweekA7: Make it fun to come to work. Help your people develop skills and empower them to do more. Communicate often so everyone knows what they‚Äôre helping to build. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/sQYGu7M2aUA6b Your strategy should include @SCOREMentors Marketing Plan Guide! Seek out the experts - they've been there, done that and know what works! https://t.co/s9JA9ThkqQ #SmallBusinessWeekThank you to @SCOREMentors for recognizing my #SmallBusiness in honor of #SmallBusinessWeek!

@LakelandChamber #LKLD https://t.co/z74VOA9XQ3@SBAgov A6: Design a professional-looking, easy-to-navigate website. We live in a mobile world. Make sure your site is optimized for mobile customers. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/j8zTnk4JZTA6 Have a strategy &amp; stick to a budget. Don't go after every customer out there - target thoughtfully and do your research. #SmallBusinessWeekA6 (2/3) ‚Äì Content marketing is one of the cheapest options for small businesses that can have a huge impact. It‚Äôs simply creating and distributing valuable information to your target audience ‚Äì through a blog, social media, videos, etc. @SBAgov #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/RClzXVa34g@SBAgov A5: A brief checklist for your business plan:
1. Executive Summary 
2. Company Overview 
3. Market Analysis
4. Product Development Plan
5. Marketing &amp; Sales Plan
6. Financial Plan &amp; Projections
7. Appendix (for the most efficient organization!) 
#SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/aPj4CicbCPA5: My @SCOREMentors likes to call it a "Business GPS." It's a guide. It can also help you pinpoint what you need to clarify #smallbusinessweek@SBAgov A5) Identify target markets and what you‚Äôll sell. Outline financial projections, including setup, ongoing costs and expected revenues. If the plan will be used to obtain funding, specify how much money is needed and why. Lay out execution steps and any risks. #SmallBusinessWeekA5: Business plan templates are a great resource to get started. You can get one @ASBDC @SBAgov website and @SCOREMentors #SmallBusinessWeekA5: There's no "one-size fits all" format for a Business Plan, but every aspiring business owner needs to get a handle on their operations, know their market &amp; competition, manage their finances. Check out @SBAgov  here: https://t.co/9WK4Z3ktC2 #SmallBusinessWeekA5b: Realistically evaluate how much it will cost to, and how you plan to, fund the business for at least the first six months. Establish reasonable financial projections. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/svXMdS3TUDA5 (1/2) ‚Äì A business plan is a roadmap to your small business‚Äôs future. It should include information on where the industry is headed, the responsibilities of the management team, and financial information (projections, cash flow statements, etc.). @SBAgov #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/D8Xk2YdVcja4 General rule is don't use your name. Lessens the value of your biz when you want to sell #smallbusinessweek@SBAgov A4) Choose a name that reflects your brand, values, and conveys your services or products. Try to think of a name that could work as a logo or resonates on social media. Verify (possibly with legal counsel) that the name isn‚Äôt already registered or being used. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/RSzwfuWQtfA4: When selecting biz name think about it from the customer's perspective - easy to remember, spell, etc.? #smallbusinessweekA4: Don't pick a name that will be limited as your business grows. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/yWsFo4M9GZA4: Also, consider how your name will be represented with your website domain and on social media profiles (eg, not all will accept the length of your name). #SmallBusinessWeek@SBAgov A4: 
ü§ó Make it meaningful and unique to you &amp; your business
‚úîÔ∏è Keep it simple
üëÄ Check if it‚Äôs an available domain to purchase (and social handles too!)
https://t.co/pfisfDeFvn 
#SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/KDahMGdSd8A3b - Check out #SCORE's #Business Fundability Quiz! It shows you which of the 9 most common business financing options your business may qualify for, and why. https://t.co/bJZXQjTx0v #SmallBusinessWeek @SCOREMentors@SBAgov A3: Seek out grants that your business may be qualified for. You may also want to consider bootstrapping too. It's tough to do, but rewarding in knowing that you were able to pay your own way and become the master of your own entrepreneurial destiny! #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/r3jWs0GILJA1: to start a small business, make sure that you have an idea that the world is ready for.  You don't necessarily need to be the first mover but make sure there is enough actual demand for your product / service #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/b2zpAL52zN@SBAgov Low cost SBA loans are known as the "gold standard" because of low rates, long terms and very low payments. Great way to grow and save $$! #SmallBusinessWeekA3b: Credit cards with high interest payments can be problematic, especially if you decide to move on from the business in the future, any remaining debt could have long term personal and business consequences. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/8dO9FXjxJcA3 Growth funds are different. With a track record, you should pursue traditional bank funding. A line of credit first #smallbusinessweeka4. There are so many funding options today, but friends &amp; family &amp; self-finding are still most popular #smallbusinessweekA2 - Start up costs should include assistance! Legal, accounting and finance experts should all be on your team bc u don't know what u don't know.  And of course #smallbiz experts like @SCOREMentors @vetbiz @ASBDC &amp; #womenBusinessCenters! #SmallBusinessWeekA2: Startup costs can be kept lower with virtual businesses and Internet-based businesses.  That's why they are increasingly popular.  #SmallBusinessWeekA2 The average cost to start a business is 25K, make that 75K+ if you are pursuing a franchise business #smallbusinessweek@SBAgov A2) While costs differ by nature of business (online vs. store front), larger costs could include:
-Lease &amp; furnishings
-Inventory or equipment
-Employee and payroll expenses
-Insurance, license &amp; permit fees
-Marketing costs
-Financing costs
#SmallBusinessWeekA2: Depends on the business you‚Äôre operating. Try to envision the 1st month of daily operations. Invest in the hardware, software &amp; supplies you need to handle the basics. Don‚Äôt get locked into long contracts w/providers; take advantage of trial periods #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/b1cg2O0R1pA2: Don't overlook the cost of IP protection, such as a trademark  #smallbusinessweeka1. Do you homework. Make sure your idea is viable. Find a support network you can trust.  #smallbusinessweekA1: Put a business plan together.  Much of it won't apply a year later, but it gets your thinking deep. The process of thinking your plan through is what's most important. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/ASDOyngsg9A1: Be sure to have the business owner mindset for ups and downs (financially/emotionally/etc.); it‚Äôs a great ride!  #smallbusinessweekA1: The first step to starting a business is to know how you plan to make money.  Passion is important, but you still have to eat. Some money is required to stay in business.  #SmallBusinessWeek@SBAgov A1: Creating a strong business plan should be everyone's first step in creating a business. #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/6dvcUgjCPT@SBAgov A1: Ask yourself why you want your own business. This is rarely an easy question to answer, but it is often the most important criteria for planning your future. Your answer will inform the way you set priorities and sharpen your vision for your business. #SmallBusinessWeekQ1 - First step to starting a #smallbiz - get family buy-in!  Surround yourself with a strong support group - then get yourself some free assistance from @SCOREMentors and @ASBDC!Welcome everyone! @SBAgov will serve as the chat ‚Äúmoderator.‚Äù We‚Äôll post questions every 5-7 minutes using the hashtag, #SmallBusinessWeek.
