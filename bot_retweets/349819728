Someone needs to stop UI management! Stop the truncation of our country's future biko!!!!! @channelstv @segalinkAgain, on a final note, 
This is to all medical students of University of Ibadan,

wherever you may be, whatever the situation may be for you, however this turns out in the end, 
I want you to know that I support your efforts and your agitations,
And I stand with you all.
Thanks.The minimum I expected from the university leadership was to have a meeting with the parents/guardians of these students, as well as the students, and not to resort to blatant bullying and forceful measures only aimed at oppressing this helpless and harmless medical students.Whatever the issues may be,
Whatever the justifications may be,
Whatever the differences may be,
People in leadership ought to know that there’s the need to put a human face to whatever actions they take &amp; whatever ideas they pursue.

This current display is a shame to be honest.These are young medical students locked outside of their own hostels simply because they dared to resist oppression and cruelty.

What happened to us as a people?
What happened to being human?
What happened to treating people like human beings even if we disagree with them?Yet earlier these morning, someone in the seat of university leadership felt that the best response to grieving helpless medical students was a display of more power and forceful ejection from their hostels.

And even now as I type this, I hear they are still outside. But why? https://t.co/bi2Em4sehXRT @HoodYeezus: Still here. #NoTo100k #SaveIbadanMedicine https://t.co/00XAFZZpLzPlease  all alumnus of college of medicine university of Ibadan, friends and wellwishers, please help us retweet, lend us your voice.
