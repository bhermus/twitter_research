Cheers to the 54 guys who rolled up their sleeves for the free men‚Äôs health screening at the recent Northern Lights @RareBeerFest. You should have your results.  Talk to your doctor. Take charge of your health! https://t.co/QNgpEYApWPThanks to our partners @4prost8health &amp; Minnesota Prostate Cancer Coalition we provided free men‚Äôs health screenings to 54 guys last night at Northern Lights @RareBeerFest. https://t.co/m7DjpUPasCA difficult statistic to read; prostate cancer now kills more people than breast cancer in the U.K.

We encourage men to take charge of their health. Know your PSA, it could save your life!
