If you continue to look above your circumstances and put your trust in God, the tears you cry today can become your ministry a year from now...Heaven becomes much more real to us when we have loved ones there.
We don't grieve hopelessly; we grieve hopefully. For the Christian, life on earth is as bad as it gets. Better things are coming.
