Giving thanks for Mexico today. Their defeat of the French at the Battle of Puebla in 1862 prevented the American Confederacy from receiving needed support and helped the Union Army win the Civil War.

https://t.co/JaX2d0qoEzDear @PressSec: You are right, @realDonaldTrump didn't have to justify his decision to fire the @FBI Director. He could have remained silent.

Also, Sean Hannity is Accused Of Sexual Harassment - probably why he needed Michael Cohen

#FireHannity https://t.co/IKDO8OTxaWI'm not sure which scares me more: how deeply Trump is attacking the foundations of our democratic institutions, or that most of the GOP don't seem to care.

#HandsOff #MedicaidMatters https://t.co/nSdL2YoqBeTrump sold out Michael Cohen last week in an effort to protect himself. This is always what you get from loyalty to Trump. He is loyal to only one man: himself.One key consequence of the experience of fear: our vision automatically narrows to focus on the perceived threat. The capacity to see much else is obliterated. This is Trump's perspective, and he has made it ours. It is traumatizing.The house (of cards) is coming down. Paul Ryan‚Äôs retirement at 48 is  stunning and heartening evidence that even an enabler who sold his soul can eventually find it intolerable to work with the man he enabled.In 2016:
70% of 18-29-year-olds DID NOT vote
60% of 30-44-year-olds DID NOT vote
Only 38% of 45-64 year olds did not vote &amp; just 15% of 65+ citizens did not vote
