Please hand the rightful winner those shopping vouchers as promised.@Dell_IN It has been a week and the #DellAtRs749 contest's winner hasn't been declared... Plese take a call. I made countless tweets for it.It's the law that gave the verdict. Blame the law if you have to, but not Salman.
#SalmanVerdictSaying #SalmanVerdict is a misjudgement just because he's a star is like saying Team India won because of the pitch.People talking about injustice should read the history of cases under the Indian Judiciary. Not the first time... #SalmanVerdictNo one was there. No one should comment either. Otherwise, please dare to step into the witness box... #SalmanVerdict@RajeshTamret Aap kaun ho bhaisaab? Ek Hindu kaun hota hai uch pata bhi hai?
Aap jaiso ki wajah se hum Pakistan ki chhavi ban ke reh jayenge@ThatScoop @BeingSalmanKhan Bond, Kamlesh Bond.@rohitshahmi07 Hum log chaat te rahenge agar aap log chatwaate rahenge.It only shows a helpless and hancuffed judiciary. But none shows that unfair judgement has been made because he's a star. #SalmanVerdict@sushantsareen I think punishing him isn't the solution either.
And it's the laws in India that bother me more than rich and powerful peopleRajkot??
