You can’t even give lower than a 1.@billy_glaser @CupcakKe_rapper mom@SSuliot OH MY GOD THIS IS SO SHEA I LOVE IT@CurtisJcurtisaz You get it!!!That’s basically all I’ve got to say. Honestly I just made this because my geology professor today tried to tell me blood was blue and didn’t believe me when I told her it’s red... but like, she was my professor and I was nervous to argue with her. 

That’s all ✨But there is also a simple way to disprove it: 
When you get your blood drawn, the blood in the tubes is red! It’s in a concealed tube, so there’s no way “oxygen could have turned” all that blood red. If blood was blue, at least the blood might be purple or something, right?We believe the myth that blood is blue because veins look blue. Basically, veins look so blue because of how we absorb and see color 🌈 

(For more on that just research the difference between veins, arteries, and capillaries) https://t.co/PCH0lCcTjKSo hemoglobin is a protein inside your red blood cells. It’s purpose is to carry oxygen!! “The primary function of red blood cells, or erythrocytes, is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues” (University of Rochester Medical Center). 

Your blood is full of oxygen!!!If you wanna seem super smart and spout off a bunch of medical knowledge to your friends/ coworkers/ classmates.... I gotchu. I’m no medical student but I did a bunch of research to debunk this myth.Lots of you have probably been told blood is blue until it hits oxygen outside of your body. This is a myth!!! I’ve been told this too. Your blood is red, a thread!!! 🍎🌹🎈🖍🍒💉♥️THREAD- Have you been told that your blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen outside your body?@Maddiehart1234 YOU ARE TOO NICE OMG NO BUT THANK U BUT YOURE WRONG BUT THANK YOU@MaigenWelch I was not ready for this@the2nddabkage That’s what you were talking about in the break room@BEAVERNUGGET3RD HAHAHAHAHAH THANK YOU MY LOVE THis is the best of everythingYOU deserve all that and more!!
