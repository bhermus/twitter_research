@Section336 @Orioles Fair answer! I still remove my ring when I golf. Can't properly grip the club with it on.üíØ https://t.co/2ug79FMf4x@Section336 @Orioles I'm questioning why your wedding ring was off...Aside from all the other questions about the envelope that are obvious.This is all because the #Caps finally won. https://t.co/FgUj8HHD5PI really don't believe it. I feel like Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out in a second.I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I JUST SAWCurrent status: #Caps https://t.co/7QJUQHjbgZThis game is going exactly how it would if the #Caps were going to lose it.@Bobby_Blanco The tweet was made with my tongue firmly planted in my cheek.Why, the Steelers love living in the past... https://t.co/woEdc2JREmCouldn't even get a member of the Washington Valor. https://t.co/zimmMdTxUgNot sure I'm ready for the heartbreak the #Caps are about to bring me, but what the hell. Let's do this.@BirdsEyeViewBal @JMcGuireMLB @EutawStReport @mattkremnitzer @JakesBabble My fantasy baseball team isn't called "Eutaw Street Misery" for nothing!@masnRoch @WordofJ No one reads the blogs, Roch. They just read the headlines. You should know this by now!@BirdsEyeViewBal @JMcGuireMLB @EutawStReport @mattkremnitzer @JakesBabble I've always considered myself a fourth-place loser, so this is fitting.@theNFLchick  https://t.co/5KG6of02q5They aren't weird. They are doing exactly what they have to do to get people to talk and generate conversation, almost like they just had you doing a second ago. https://t.co/guIoztgS6YWhy would he call to congratulate him? That would be incredibly weird. He's a teammate. Did he call Hurst to congratulate him? He was actually drafted higher... https://t.co/8x5Eu5Y7DxBy weird, I hope you mean "weird that all kinds of outlets are writing stories about something so incredibly dumb" and not weird that JF has yet to speak to LJ yet. https://t.co/7gbVz7q9eo@MikesPencil You don‚Äôt need to include me in the tweet if I‚Äôm not meant to see it. Learn how to use the medium before explaining your reasoning to others.@MikesPencil @WordofJ You did reply to me. That‚Äôs why I saw the tweet. But thanks anyhow.One of the keys to the season for the #Orioles is working out, even if the season itself is not. At all. https://t.co/6423h6KtO8@jessemcgee I‚Äôm not employed by MASN. I‚Äôm also not really being a homer, which is something that is evident if you read the piece.@MikesPencil @WordofJ I‚Äôm not media, nor am I employed by MASN. I‚Äôm also not really being a homer, which is evident if you read the piece.@bgpowelll He basically made the point that it's not in the nature of ownership to just fire leadership mid-season. They wouldn't have a desire to make that messy transition. But also said something has to change sooner than later.@bgpowelll Did you even read the Rosenthal piece?@bgpowelll I think based on everything I've read, that he's essentially operating as the GM right now. It doesn't seem like DD is doing much of anything.@bgpowelll Based on everything reported, I don't think that's a conversation that's even necessary.Things are happening...unless they aren't https://t.co/EoHGK994O2@BirdlandDaily He's my fatherTomorrow at @masnOrioles - A look at how one of the preseason keys to a successful season for the #Orioles is actually happening...even if they aren't winning any games.According to my Facebook post, the #Orioles had this best record in baseball on this date six years ago. Today, they have the worst record in baseball.This Angels-M‚Äôs game is bonkers@DSzymborski  https://t.co/NbrEzVGPlcI could‚Äôve swore they did this twice last week https://t.co/z2JM4be0ut@Nick_Verd I bet they could win at least half of the games the current team has.@Nick_Verd **shrug emoji** gotta field a team of Gentry/Peterson types then, I suppose@RantingOriole I simply don't get all of the praise DD gets. It's crazy to me.@Nick_Verd No, I wouldn't want to have Rule 5ers, per say. I'd rather see prospects in our system that we think have a chance to develop. Hays/Stewart types. But lord knows there isn't enough of them to field a team.@Nick_Verd That's not for me to answer, it's something they stated they were doing at the start of the season. If they'd have said we are going through a rebuild, I'd have been totally on board.I continue to hear this line. I'm not convinced Buck Showalter would choose to keep 3 Rule 5 players at the start of the season if he had a choice in the matter. https://t.co/vwxfPVZuSd@Nick_Verd teams that are trying to win don't keep Rule 5 players. Much less 3 of them.@Nick_Verd What tipped me off?Why does the chef keep cooking with the poop that's in the pantry? Because sometimes you have to cook with the ingredients that are given to you. https://t.co/SaANR9trx3Crazy what happens when you play 11 games with 22 major leaguers on your roster then another 22 games with 23 major leaguers. Everyone else gets to use 25 real baseball players. #OriolesThis tweet is about to get eviscerated. https://t.co/9BRL170GB0Another interesting scenario where Machado is left on deck. Potentially w/o the chance to hit at all there.Probably not though lol https://t.co/ClwMkSzRCzSo @KaceyMusgraves is on #SNL next week and I'd rather it just be an episode where she performs her new album, is that cool with everyone?Looks like it avoided fingers. But caught wrist. Still not good.Welp.@gnarlyshriek I LOLed tooKevin Gausman bout to throw a CGSO out here and not get a W. Peak Orioles.Aside from Jimmy Fallon and Stormy Daniels, that #SNL Open was pretty on point.Kevin Gausman https://t.co/qbECnML8ixThis is an oldie but a goody, imhoI call them the ‚Äúriles,‚Äù cause, you know... https://t.co/gtg79WVECwLeBron James has all of the infinity stones.JR Smith was laughing because what else can you doLeBron is just stupid good@mattkremnitzer Totally agree. It‚Äôs a weird season on all fronts.@mattkremnitzer It‚Äôs also funny that that‚Äôs what constitutes going at each other.I've reached that point in my day where I've been sitting on the couch for so long that it's now dark outside and there are no lights on in my living room so it is very dark. I need to get up and turn the lights on is the moral of the story.Being a #Caps fans is great because you get to experience the joy of a win like tonight while still realizing the darkness that awaits you over the next two games.Machado never looked confident on that pop up.the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over. the series is not over.WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGut check time for the CapsTell me again how Ovechkin is overrated?https://t.co/jukPMbkRlpStill a chance at this, y'all. https://t.co/EbaQzQ9G3NKuzy!A perfect game with 27 strikeouts would actually be historic, you guys. I would actually watch that. https://t.co/UKaVvBY4N3I just tweeted my buddy who is a Mariners fan that I want the O's to trade Erik Bedard to Seattle again just to get the social media person. Will let you know if he wants to take the deal.This is how every single team should tweet out their lineup. No excuses not to. https://t.co/2eRZ7I8pS6#Caps have been thoroughly outplayed in 4 of the last 5 periods of hockey.Using my real first name, which few on this website would know, would open up a lot of possibilities.I wish I could go Andruw Jones, but I don‚Äôt think that counts. I guess Pettitte gets the nod for me? https://t.co/kLjzwE5EZ4Perhaps he can send the start of this season to Wakanda https://t.co/t0tEm15hYB@GDixon410 DefinitelyMy GAWD Holtby@RomeroJoseM Lol I know you don't. Just messing with you.@RomeroJoseM bad parenting imhoThat was a pretty dominating damn victory for #Justify. #KentuckyDerbyLarry Collmus is excellent, in case you forgot.1 - I'm shocked President Trump has anyone who would consider themselves one of his "close friends."

2 - I'm more shocked Trump would be friends with someone named "Barrack." https://t.co/CYpnkcvvcCAbsolutely not nice. https://t.co/hxmvOsQIQj@bgpowelll Would rather it not for the top 4‚Äôs sakeThat was always going to happen. Good lord, Spurs.This is another super hidden benefit to living in a place where there is no weedwacking to be done. https://t.co/iKs0UMA1FxBrad Brach‚Äôs tumble from high-leverage reliever to now has been steep.Shohei Ohtani is a ridiculously good hitter.Jesus. https://t.co/PMoKxm4qeQ@lauratrags He‚Äôs on deck, so...@lauratrags  https://t.co/QnAVYGb8P0#Orioles games are officially worth watching because you never know on which night you may see another 30-3 game.It also absolutely does not matter because nothing matters anymore.I don't see how that's Peterson's error. It was a pretty bad throw by Machado.@PhilBackert I mean, I'm an O's fan so I'm biased. But these A's unis are absolute fire emoji.The #Orioles have no chance tonight against the A's with them wearing those uniforms.@AJMass Can you come up with any reason to keep David Price around on a roster? I could basically use the spot to stream starters or pick up a MR for holds (which I've been punting) in a weekly h2h. Otherwise team is in decent shape.@andybehrens Can you come up with any reason to keep David Price around on a roster? I could basically use the spot to stream starters or pick up a MR for holds (which I've been punting) in a weekly h2h.

Otherwise team is in decent shape.üíØ https://t.co/TSpvwWFBIjThis #Orioles team may legitimately be worse than the 1988 team. And it may not be close.That ball has to be caught by Davis...should be an error@hardly_jj SoonI‚Äôm getting all of these angry tweets out now because I will be asleep soon.Santander‚Äôs throw home ALMOST made it to 1B.This is definitely happening for me https://t.co/f8H9Is8X88Perhaps in this inningDon‚Äôt worry, Angels fans. Pujols will have plenty more cracks at it tonight.Chance Sisco doesn‚Äôt even know where the ball is going to go. He looks like he‚Äôs guessing on every pitch.The only shock is that Trout didn‚Äôt get two more feet on that one for a oppo boppo.@Nick_Verd I‚Äôm even fine with hitting Manny leadoff. I‚Äôm always in favor of getting your best hitter more chances for at bats.@BarstoolRDT Good grief https://t.co/rdOVSH0fZKChris Tillman should take some advice from Trevor Bauer and use all the pine tar.@Nick_Verd Weird, too, cause the Angels have this guy named Trout hitting #2.I'll repeat this - just because I can - There's no reason Jace Peterson should be hitting in the #2 hole for this team. Hit Machado there. Call it a day.Time to watch Chris Tillman play stopper for the #Orioles https://t.co/G1Q5NdsFaD@PepeRosas84 it's all fantasy baseball/golf for meno freaking doubt https://t.co/ZxmKBrvTRkMan the Caps just pooed all over themselves tonight.Incredible that Holtby waited so long to clear the cage@JBabsSportsChic @BirdsEyeViewBal Used to deal with them when I did that too. It‚Äôs really quite simple, especially when they only read the headline of your work.@BirdsEyeViewBal I merely share my writing in there, then duck out. But the comments have been flowing like that lava since my controversial Monday piece. Oh well.@davelozo @espn I don't understand how NBC can be so good at PL coverage and so awful at NHL.I've had people in #Orioles Facebook comment land debating Chris Davis' batting stance for four days. Does anyone have a noose?Someone please stop Mookie Betts.There's really no need for a second round of the horn, Pittsburgh.@SammyB2052 hell I thought they had a goal on the other side of the cage at firstDefinitely a goalFairly certain the Pens just scored.@theNFLchick And ppl still complain that the Ravens paid Joe. As if the entire market wasn't heading this way for QBs.The Capitals are showing why you don't get excited when they win a thrilling Game 3 on the road to take a series lead. Because then they come out and play like crap.Let's get weird https://t.co/bXhFvLXTrcThis dude that used to be in the Mickey Mouse Club is pretty good. #ManOfTheWoods https://t.co/xjzntxIBnb@wochnick This tweet has zero context@mattkremnitzer I always think it‚Äôs a typo@EddieInTheYard Nice to see they moved the press box back to a respectable place rather than in RF@matthewsoffer @Cheywhitey Not something I frequent@Cheywhitey That‚Äôs a disappointing hot take. Who said this?Part ( not the biggest, but part ) of the problem with this, is that there are NFL fans that think this is no big deal. https://t.co/ScGCHzzVjr@wochnick They are@lauratrags @Dubvallstar1 I‚Äôm a child. It‚Äôs a üí© joke.@lauratrags @Dubvallstar1 https://t.co/nxr7D5JrYr@lauratrags @Dubvallstar1 You‚Äôve never seen Wreck It Ralph?@lauratrags @Dubvallstar1  https://t.co/wWUGaSRdAoCobb has looked sharp tonight. His breaking stuff is crisp and he has good location on his fastball.üëè https://t.co/EAxRK8GO8ZNot to "well actually" you, but...he's playing SS. https://t.co/WzahwaejyhPedro Alvarez - Still not a third baseman.@lauratrags Correct. And I was wrong on Astros. You can now stream in-market Astros games through ROOT. It's only O's/Nats/Dodgers that don't have in-market streaming service.@lauratrags @masnOrioles There's actually only four teams (I think) that don't. It's O's/Nats (MASN), Dodgers and Astros.@lauratrags @masnOrioles ESPN+ has the game tonight if you pay for that. Not sure about blackout restrictions though. I know https://t.co/RY5rdvkORe has blackout restrictions.Ohtani runs pretty fast for a guy with a sprained ankle.Machado should not be hitting 3rd. He should be hitting 1st or 2nd for the #Orioles. The real lesson is that Jace Peterson shouldn‚Äôt be hitting 2nd.OVIIIIIII@bgpowelll Yeah I'm up every day at 4am. Normally not an issue when games end at 7-7:30 my time. But when they start at that time...@bgpowelll An actual job that pays money lol. I work in a restaurant in food service.I work on an East Coast type of schedule time-wise, so this week is going to be rough on me for O's games. I'm already sitting here wondering how I'll make it to 7pm.No one was stopping all of that noise. My gawd.@scott_pianowski the best. And you can watch Trumbo/Davis/Mancini/Alvarez and all the other 1B/DH types try to hit a ball out there.Niskanen just made a better save than either goalie has tonightIt's right next to Boog's BBQ. https://t.co/QtYPo9DEa0The #Orioles could use a 1B/DH type. They should look into this. https://t.co/3rNMZALCj1This is the biggest "no sh*t" story of the day? https://t.co/kVatFvYaYa@StanTheFan Much smaller sample size, but a twist of the knife nonetheless.Actually, I can absolutely believe it.I can‚Äôt believe the #Orioles failed to hold on to two different Andrew Millers. https://t.co/orl1sQVvVAIf you guessed that more than half the replies to this tweet mention Corey Seager and Manny Machado, you‚Äôd be right! https://t.co/zWwucE4VF9Oh, cool, Josh Hader did a thing. https://t.co/gzylT0LuXvYou don't say! https://t.co/jI9NsI3aNMThe #Dodgers need a SS. The #Orioles have a SS. Hmmmm. https://t.co/1oBQ2Bxqlt@TL8throum Thanks. Based on the response I‚Äôve received today, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre correct.A look at the Chris Davis contract: https://t.co/424TWwirv1 #Orioles@lauratrags Oh good griefIf there‚Äôs one thing we learned from tonight‚Äôs big Sunday Night Baseball clash between the #Yankees and #Angels, it‚Äôs that umpire Angel Hernandez is still incredibly awful at his job.@bengraver Yeah only cost I have to figure is game ticket and hotel Saturday night.@brandonnagy Saturday is probably my only shot. The flight is free, only cost I need to work out is game ticket and hotel Saturday night.Man, Pedro Alvarez is definitely not a third baseman.How is this much hypocrisy even able to fit into one tweet? https://t.co/70KT3Tb3XvI don‚Äôt believe one second of what this team is spewing. This is a complete farce. https://t.co/vPxeQa7zuh@brandonnagy Interesting. A day trip may be in order.@GlennClarkRadio By Monday morning. I want to hear your takes on the show tomorrow. I‚Äôm seeing it in a few hours.SF/Oakland people, how easy is travel in/out of OAK airport to and from a baseball game? Uber easily available? Hotels nearby? Considering a one-nite trip in Saturday. Help me out with info.(No one does) https://t.co/c1sbqvmr0A@kulwicky Oh. No, I didn't. That changes everything.@kulwicky Did they change it so that you can have 6 OL and 2 QBs on the field at the same time? No? Ok then.I so badly miss writing headlines, like this gem on ESPN. https://t.co/1GZgO4AV3sThe #Ravens now have too many QBs, too many OL and not enough WRs.@BRILLIANT2552  https://t.co/ecw6HzB3mfJeeze, when are the #Ravens going to pay attention to their defense? Are they ONLY going to draft offensive players this year???? #NFLDraftWhat is happening.The Ravens have watched every single WR get picked tonight.Machado is ridiculous
