@DyerTom1 @TomLaws Bit random 😅I'm not a jazz star. I could just about manage little donkey on the keyboard and that was in middle school. https://t.co/cNtEZrddsa@dayne_allen Early bird gets the worm. Your worm needs to be out there for the bird.@dayne_allen Sorry, I got bored.Haven't played football in so long. I imagine if I even tried to kick a ball I'd end up tripping over my own dick.On the bright side, at least we now have confirmation that Americans are one again stupider than the British.Waking up is easily the worst part of the day. Just the immediate realisation that the sweet release of death is yet to welcome you.@selinafox5 Get your backside off twitter then 😅@DyerTom1 Fish vagina.@Sport__WAGs @dayne_allen @NJLurkins@AllannahTall Holy shit 😂😂 That was damn brilliant hah.Nearly ran a bloody deer over on a bike. Could've had that for dinner.@selinafox5 So do I. Woke up to a stupidly long story -_-@selinafox5 Not to mention having ya backside out on snapchat. Again 😅Well I'm fucking dying -_-@selinafox5 If only it was the top that you'd gotten too big for 😉😂@selinafox5 You're probably one of the few that could keep up with her anyway 😉 xxx@selinafox5 It is indeed. Same place as well. Tuesday 19th. I'll vouch for you if you did 😅 xxx@AllannahTall That 'damn walk' was worth it though 😉

Hold on, I'll message you. Character limits -_-@AllannahTall No you just have a bad memory 😂

Nahh I live down Walmer Road now.@selinafox5 ...fuck it I'll admit it. I want you to come as well 😇 xx@AllannahTall This one in particular? All on me, I'll admit.
Bit weird if it were you, not too sure you know where I live 😅Another works night soon. Should survive this one better without @selinafox5 dragging me downstairs for tequila constantly.@AllannahTall After finding random marshmallows I've come to the conclusion that for the majority it was my fault. Enhanced by you of courseWhy does @DyerTom1 think he's allowed to be a normal 22 year old by going out on a Friday night and abandoning me -_-@DomDom1919 Never. Sounds good, though I can't do next week because I'm doing loads of extra shifts. 
I have yours, unless you have a new 1.@DomDom1919 This is why we aren't compatible.Almost time to go to my first job of the day to earn a currency that's falling in value.
Fucking nice.@selinafox5 Am I going to wake up to a 357 second long Snapchat story? 😂@AllannahTall 10 years older than Tilly as well 😊@AllannahTall She's 14 bless her :)@selinafox5 Fuck sake, Sel... I don't think I want to know actually haha@selinafox5 What did you do 😂@selinafox5 How is that a problem?You're not disabled, you're fat. Maybe parking away from the shop as opposed to a disabled spot you'd lose some weight walking...@selinafox5 Yea, most people share that problem😅@selinafox5 Stop being a cunt then.@AllannahTall One day we shall 😊@AllannahTall (Philosopher's) https://t.co/7w2MaJqqgHIs it too early to go to bed...@NJLurkins Need to sack your provider 😅@NJLurkins Dude you might as well live in a cave with your trusty wooden club.What a lovely dream, both my dog and my sister died. That seemed far too real 🤔#JFT96 https://t.co/7BE0OPrhuJProbably not the best idea staying up till gone 4am considering I've got two jobs today 🤔Every time I'm on Facebook I see " @selinafox5 has replied to a comment" and it's always a picture of someone with a massive forehead 😂Is it really considered a missed call if I pick up my phone, see who's ringing and then put the phone down again?@DomDom1919 Can you even buy devices without 4G anymore?@dayne_allen 😍My body is not designed to be awake at 6am, nor is it set up for work at 7am -_-Shitty weather -_-Shorts!!!Fucking TV reflection on the window shat me right up -_-@selinafox5 Probably better than anything you'd want to listen to 😅McDonald's for lunch, Chinese for dinner...now for dessert.I hate having to be the bigger person -_-@AllannahTall So the complete opposite. Well, all the best 😇@AllannahTall Someone on holiday? 😊Sort of want to watch 'The Boy'. Two problems though... I don't want to, plus I'd need @AllannahTallFinally get home after doing both jobs back to back to turn the TV on and see David fucking Cameron. As if my day wasn't bad enough.@DomDom1919 What are they going to do?
Fine them? Can't pay that.
Prison? Roof over their heads? Sorted.Probably should have gone to bed rather than watch Hunger Games given I've got work in the morning...@selinafox5 No. Just no.Going to be one of those nights of laying around for hours on end not being able to sleep -_-@selinafox5 Pretty good thanks, yourself?
Quieter. Much quieter 😂 xx@selinafox5 I would say the one that highlights your boobs, but...yeah 😇@DyerTom1 @XboxAchs You'll still be at uni/school.Let the dog in from the garden to see a bird had shit on her head.
If she could convey embarrassment, she would have.@AllannahTall Many years ago I seem to remember you not wearing one, claiming "it makes then look better" 😉@SkyHelpTeam Its all been sorted. Just thought it was funny a suggestion is to check your website, which is inaccessible without the WiFi 😅Best part about @SkyUK is that if your WiFi is down they suggest checking their website for a solution. Kinda need the WiFi for that guys.@selinafox5 I hope none of them see that and consider it a challenge 😂@selinafox5 Not the guys fault they look creepy with cheeseballs on their nips.Tried to flash my car lights at someone for letting me out and pulled the wrong thing. Ended up turning on my rear window wiper -_-@DyerTom1 I've changed my mind. You can go fuck yourself.@selinafox5 So when you Snapchat the rest of us you're looking attractive?!? I'd hate to see the photos you send them 😉 xGetting up at 7am for @DyerTom1 . If that's not proof of my love I don't know what is 😂@DyerTom1 @XboxAchs You should really read things before tagging me dude. First it was a ps4 game, now something outside of the UK haha@AllannahTall I would've used a different word, but sure. Let's go with persistent. For my own safety@AllannahTall Really? After all these years you still won't hold your hands up and admit the truth 😂@AllannahTall like let's follow this pathway into a field. But out loud it's not so clever.@AllannahTall If its what I think, then no my dear. It wasn't double edged.
Most things sound good in your head,@AllannahTall I'm not sure if I'm stupid or just ridiculously fatigued, either way... What? 😅Had dreams about Liverpool winning a game of football and then of @AllannahTall ... Didn't realise I missed the second one.@dayne_allen Pushed away, into something better.@NJLurkins Remember us joking about a nil nil game after that 3-3... Well I think it's even more likely now.@MRWicks94 Feel my pain.@MRWicks94 Oh I'd actually forgotten about that, damn you for reminding me. I was referring to some of the judges decisions.@MRWicks94 Let's just hope it has no bullshit this time.@selinafox5 Does that honestly surprise you?Someone should do some (many) shots with me.@NJLurkins Pretty much. Can't wait to fall asleep watching it.@NJLurkins Our strikers are dead too 😅@NJLurkins Look on the bright side. You've leant to score just as every Liverpool defender died.A celebrity has died. Can only mean one thing. It's time to avoid social media for a day or two.2am and I'm watching a documentary on polar bears...@selinafox5 How original and mature of you 😅 x@selinafox5 Love you really 😇@selinafox5 I hate to spoil the surprise, but they're taking you to the vets. They can't put up with you so they're having you put down.@dayne_allen 😘@selinafox5 Don't be mean I'm tired -_- 😅 xxx@selinafox5 Same reason as you. Only I don't work late nights... My body is just fucked on its own hah xx@selinafox5 Your tweets make me want things I can't have 😠@selinafox5 The fuck are you still awake for? 😅@selinafox5 Think you misunderstood... I was not going 😊@selinafox5 Don't make me regret not going 😅@MensPictures @dayne_allen@DomDom1919 At least she doesn't keep secrets from you.@DomDom1919 That's sweet@DomDom1919 Did anyone text you? 😂I hope everyone enjoys another year of plummeting further into dept and still having nothing to live for.Gotta go to work when I wake up. Here's hoping I don't wake up 🍻Couldn't decide between McDonalds or Chinese...so I had both and I regret everything.Randomly found a marshmallow in my bed. If I didn't know any better I'd have already blamed you @AllannahTall@dayne_allen &lt;3@dayne_allen Just imagine how nice you'll feel when it's the sound of rain on your gravestone.@DomDom1919 I thought that was your punishment.Waking up to a ridiculously long Snapchat story is not how I want to start my day off, @selinafox5Going home. Work tomorrow. Couldn't bring an elf with me. Shite times.Shot down by an elf. What is life?I'm not leaving Finland unless I can take these 'elfs' with me 😍@DomDom1919 Meeting Santa@dayne_allen I know, if only I'd have thought to bring some shorts -_-@dayne_allen Thought of it. Done it. Got a fire going 😅Tuesday is looking nice. https://t.co/lclQsbpKmmSo, boxing is rather violent. Who knew?@BooBitch124 Melons 😂😂
