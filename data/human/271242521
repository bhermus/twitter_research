Old Balls essentially saying the same but with that beautiful Old Balls touch https://t.co/avALIOUanEYou should probably be a little more mad that your inept coaches managed to blow a 25 point lead in the first place #runtheball #NotDone https://t.co/t3zL3SjPUY@RyanHathaway617 it‚Äôs #TerryTime https://t.co/ypICwVXDPcI had to buy tickets to the afc ship solely because I couldn‚Äôt stand to hear romo call another pats game https://t.co/2RrPBAhKT7#BellLetsTalk@LevyPool Full yet?DA touchdown, DLew fumble and a Gilmore deep pass breakup?

Because all the idiots of the SEC are taking credit for all of Bama‚Äôs accomplishment. The SEC needs Bama, Bama doesn‚Äôt need the SEC. This is a Bama legacy. I bet Georgia went home last night and said, ‚Äúat least the SEC won amiright‚Äù@gbonica9 Championships since 1985..
ACC: 8
Bama: 6
Rest of SEC: 6
B1G: 6
Big 12: 4
 They picked 15 years to make their point. Because that‚Äôs the beauty of statistics@gbonica9 Since 2009, Alabama is 5-1, rest of SEC is 1-3 in championship game. Statistical manipulation goes both ways@gbonica9 The rest of the dumpster that is the SEC loves taking pride in Bama accomplishments like they are SEC accomplishments. Bama is the SEC but the SEC is not BamaSkewed stat at its finest. The SEC lost this championship. Bama won it https://t.co/vgkOZIzvuBTails never fails.
