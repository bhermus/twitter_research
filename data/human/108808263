This is crazy 😳 https://t.co/mj3KwVqgElThis can’t be real. There’s gotta be a twist. Something has to happen. #InfinityWarJust watched Avengers Infinity War... I. Am. At. A. Loss. Of. Words. I. Am. Shooketh.@derekmadden @Mets #ChopOn https://t.co/LGlxuIOwt8@derekmadden Lots of pizza rolls. That’s what worked for me growing up anyways... that and cinnamon toast 🤷🏻‍♂️@jakedgoode Bro... you use twitter to vent don’t you 😂 

Also... nah. I can’t agree to that!Victor Oladipo is a MACHINE. Let’s send this to a game 7!!!Bruh... I’d be sleepin so quick 😴 https://t.co/IGwfqFe1u5Omg I literally just started community tonight! https://t.co/I9eWkuwQ8o@jakedgoode @YouTubeTV It was blacked out on @Sling too. Such a joke@austinpax I just have a soft spot in my heart for PG since I’m a Pacers fan lol. Ingles is definitely in his head but PG still droppin 30 a game this series. Melo has been non existent and they miss Roberson on defense so badThis may be an unpopular opinion but I’m starting to not really like Russell Westbrook anymore...Carmelo Anthony is GARBAGE. You’re known for offense but you have been a non factor this entire seriesI love Paul George... I despise Joe InglesThis is about as useful as my “team academic state championship” ring I have from high school for having the highest gpa as a team in the whole state. https://t.co/xh3yIjKqdXhttps://t.co/imMLZICFtH

Exhibit A https://t.co/sADfsGxcRPLeBron saying “cmon” after explaining what happened as if it was pathetic that Lance flopped to draw the technical is hilarious to me. LBJ flops ALL THE TIME and he’s 6’8” 250 pounds. https://t.co/hFaneSwY9P@beauwaddell He reached his hands up over his head to try and tie the ball up and the offensive player started twisting to break free then they fell to the floor. Lance probably did try to roll him over to establish dominance and that caused Green to get all emotional lolHow that was a hostile act by Lance Stephenson... I’ll never know.@beauwaddell He killed us down the stretch 😔Arkansas can’t handle The Dude https://t.co/38koM9ddL6What a start to the weekend. @HailStateBB upsets Arkansas and the @Pacers win to go up 2-1 against the Cavs. My teams were nice 👌🏼@dak hey man... you’re my favorite player. I’m getting married June 23rd and we’re sending you an invite. If you’re feelin like sending a wedding gift I’d gladly take a signed jersey or something! Lol. #HailStateForever can’t hurt to ask 🤷🏻‍♂️ 🤞🏼Bruh... not me. I’d be OUTTA there. That’s impressive https://t.co/AdIhXYMjoNAny of the USC, Notre Dame, or Michigan teams in the last decade that gets preseason ranked just because of their name https://t.co/cP57kvfLlJ@beauwaddell Man I’ve never looked that close at that pic but he was DEEP in that noseHahaha https://t.co/mhFwhy13ad@beauwaddell Man I hate to tell you but the ceiling for y’all is like a 7 win season and it’s probably gonna be a 5 or 6 win season for y’all 😂7 https://t.co/hNUFzmHIS7@derekmadden @DevInTheLab They need me@derekmadden @DevInTheLab The suns were so garbage this year. They need somethin!@CoachEvins @CBSSportsCFB @BarrettSallee Oh yea lolWhat 10 people voted against this?! 😳 https://t.co/H9a9yBiQMDThis is hilarious and so awesome https://t.co/NfmWE7SNGs@weatherdan Sleet in Siloam Springs and then again in North Fayetteville on my way into town@SECcountry  https://t.co/F63sTs9rmaI kept asking @urbsandspices what movies I should rent this evening and she had every single one I was asking about. That was followed up with “Boy. Arby’s has the meats. I have the movies.”@grant_dooley Taking games away from Little Rock so they put the spring game there to maybe make the central Arkansas people happy lol that’s my guess@GJoslyn91 Do you think y’all win any of these? 

@ Miami @ Florida @ Auburn@GJoslyn91 Bruh UGA and Bama are for sure L’s. We’re also loaded. But I agree we could easily lose that game in Death Valley. Lots of unknowns for us. With your toss up games you play at Florida, Auburn, and A&amp;M. If Fisher prevents A&amp;M’s usual end of season collapse that could be an L@GJoslyn91 Lol bro I’m seeing it like this. 

For sure wins: SE LA, La Tech, Ole Miss, Arkansas, Rice

Toss Ups: Florida, Texas A&amp;M, Miami, Mississippi State (we gonna get that dub though) 

Losses: Auburn, Georgia, Bama 

Out of the toss ups I think you lose to MSU and MiamiAccurate. Except Mississippi State wins 9 maybe 10 🤷🏻‍♂️ and LSU wins 7 https://t.co/UNQ5bnda0VWhat.... https://t.co/lGDePrfr68Jeremiah 1:12 “God watches over his word to perform it.” Study and pray over his word so God can perform it in our lives just as Jesus did. 

The word caught me this morning lol.It’s the same God living in me that worked miracles through Jesus, led people to salvation and raised Jesus back from the dead. That’s powerful. How big of a difference could I be making every day with people I come into contact with but havnt really tapped into the power of GodIt’s crazy to think about how the same God that lived in Jesus lives in me 

“And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, then He who raised Christ from the dead will also bring your mortal bodies to life through His Spirit who lives in you.”Romans 8:11Omg... Donte DiVincenzo is unstoppable right now. The man is going off. This is amazing. #FinalFour #NationalChampionship@AGC1281 @HailStateWBK Yep. William was tackled at halfcourt to cause that turnover. Our best free throw shooter should’ve been shooting 2 to win the game with 3 seconds to go. Very frustrating way to lose a NC gameIm finally calmed down from bein so upset earlier. I wanted this group of girls to win so bad. I went from watchin 2 @HailStateWBK games in a decade to never missing a televised game in the last 2 years. This team made thousands of new fans. They’ve been special #HailState #PTLGDThank you @Blair__Schaefer @VictoriaVivians @_MorganWilliam2 @roshundaj11 for turning this program around, for making thousands of new fans for this sport and for representing women &amp; Mississippi State with class &amp; hard work. We’re grateful &amp; blessed to have had you! #HailStateI’ve had the privilege of watching Mississippi State lose 3 national championships in the last 5 years. The heart break doesn’t stopThe life of a Mississippi State fan is brutalI just watched Friends from start to finish for the first time... just saw the series finale... seeing them walk out and that apartment being completely empty just made my chest ACHE! Why do I keep doing this to myself 😭UCONN has lost in the final four on a buzzer beater in overtime two years in a row. Last year vs Mississippi State and this year vs Notre Dame. That’s roughMan... this Notre Dame vs UCONN game is REALLY good. So many big shots!This year we’ve ended Louisville’s football season in the Gator bowl. We’ve ended their men’s basketball season in the NIT final four. And now we just ended their women’s basketball season in the final four. Keep holding up them L’s Louisville! We own you! #HailState https://t.co/iu1r4nVGrCHail Freakin State! Back to back seasons playing in a national championship for @HailStateWBK 

So pumped for this group! #HailState https://t.co/VKsc0CrDxcI dunno man... @HailStateFB has potentially 2 first round draft picks on the DL. 🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/tc8RleXP99Opening Day! Im ready see this young team get rolling! #ChopOnThis is the most important poll that you could ever take part in.... HELP END THE DEBATE! If you had to choose which would you pick?I don’t even know how one goes about a 21-0 run... I’m so pissed right now.Can’t we find another year of eligibility or something for them? https://t.co/vDdwQlEYkg2 straight Final Fours for @HailStateWBK 

This has been the most fun team to watch! These ladies can BALL! 2 more wins to send these seniors out with a championship! #HailState@derekmadden bruh... we’re gonna be so good next year https://t.co/iW3PDzkSgm@derekmadden @DevInTheLab https://t.co/IeT4eYhoiLHoly crap we’re lookin good! Let’s go! @HailStateMBK #HailState@derekmadden @urbsandspices I’m going to kill you lol@derekmadden @urbsandspices derek don’t you love this iconic song from this iconic movie for these game winning clips like this https://t.co/pjq2XSgVcMBuzzer beater!!! Holy crap I think that’s the first time in my life something like that has gone Mississippi States way 😭 

I know it’s the NIT but this is our first postseason play in like 7 years so back off 

#HailStateXavian Stapleton in some way screws the team every game. 

Q loves to wildly drive into the paint and throw the ball up and flail his arms to draw a foul and it works 1 out of 10 times. Usually always a turnover so that awesome. 

This is the most frustrating team in the countryOmg... that finish for Michigan... this is insane. #MarchMadness has been on another level. Poor HoustonI told my brother Landon that he’s got some serious kyphosis going on with his posture and he says to me... “what is that?? A sorority?” He had the most serious expression on his face 😂Arkansas 2017-2018 team lived and died by the jump shot. #RIPI have 3 brackets. In two I had Arkansas in the elite 8. In the other I had them in the sweet 16. NEVER AGAIN WILL I TRUST THE HOGS@GJoslyn91 @LSUfootball That’s gonna be a good game man!@GJoslyn91 @abdulamemon Homecoming? What you talkin about? Lol@GJoslyn91 @PeterBurnsESPN @mspears96 @SIRIUSXM I would agree with them on that if I’m looking for a pro QB. But he could climb those rankings if he comes back improved in the passing game and completely healed from that ankle injury. Still pissed about that broken ankle😳 https://t.co/tsCHowDU6sDavian Stapleton... dude you are worthless. You just had a wide open three to win the game and blew it@derekmadden @sixpackspeak Yea man I’ve been just looking at that move from every possible angle and this one kinda captures just how nasty it was lol@grant_dooley Think DeQueen has enough hotels to accommodate 20-30k fans?Dumb... it’s really dumb. Nashville, Memphis, New Orleans, Atlanta should be the options https://t.co/qET4l8PS6LEvery single game... we get in a lull, turn the ball over. The other team gets hot makes a run after we built a big lead and then it all comes burning down. So frustrating@GJoslyn91 We’re young too man! Not a single senior and only one junior lol.@GJoslyn91 Lol of course! I don’t feel confident in our team at allPlease please please cut Stapleton from our team this offseason @Ben_Howland@GJoslyn91 Yea it’s a good haul lol. It’s 7 hours from me@GJoslyn91 Lol yea baseball stadiums can pack in more than they list. I’m gonna have to get to Starkville next spring for the Super Bulldog Weekend. We always have a big series scheduled and the football spring game in one weekend. Gotta see this stadium@GJoslyn91 Oh yea. Maybe more with the berms on both sides and the entire outfield being ready with the lounges and decking. The entire concourse has perfect sight lines too so if we sold standing room only I bet we could pack in 16-18k for a regional@GJoslyn91 We’re playing games in it this year but it won’t be completed until the end of this summer I think.It’s beautiful 😍😭 https://t.co/ePm8vBSkEGAfter Mississippi States basketball performance the last two games... https://t.co/489VFm6d0yDo we have anyone on our roster that can guard Schofield? He’s abusing our big men. GET IN THE FRIGGIN WEIGHT ROOM...We look like hot garbage out there tonight... like a completely different team.I remember when they picked us dead last in preseason. #HailState https://t.co/3xoQJb8DEJOur last game we scored 79... but still #HailState https://t.co/j7gPzva9dL@CoachHuff44 Apparently he cheated on his wife with an assistant in the athletic department. Dude threw away everything. Can’t believe itCan’t believe our baseball coach is gone... can’t believe he made this stupid mistake and threw a dream job and huge opportunity away on a dumb decision.@derekmadden I mean the whole country is talking about this 😂 maybe it was a publicity stunt... I’m just trying to think of any reason why this could’ve been so bad. I’m shocked@derekmadden I get more uncomfortable every time I watch it... like it almost has to be an intentional butchering of the anthem I feel like 😂My favorite quote of the day: “Uh Ohhhhhh... I look incredible” *dances vigorously* 

@urbsandspices While trying on outfits for engagement photosAhhh I hate when that happens! https://t.co/baMetXNWIH@GJoslyn91 @SECNetwork Hmmm I still think we should be higher than that lol but I’m ok with that because we never really get respect anywaysGo vote... it takes 2 seconds. It helps me and it helps my town. Our town will be on a tv series and we’ll get $500,000 infused into our downtown development. https://t.co/6gagjezSUhI hope Georgia destroys Florida... I honestly hope every Florida athletic program falls apart. My hatred for them rivals my hatred for Ole Miss now... and I actually used to like Florida https://t.co/4QtvsnMMHd@beauwaddell @austinpax Never forget https://t.co/xPdNo0JJH0@AGC1281 @austinpax I’m goin by actual 247 website rankings on these 🤷🏻‍♂️ don’t hate me@GJoslyn91 Y’all need to get a QB. That’s all LSU has ever needed@GJoslyn91 Right now... I dunno how many would choose Arkansas over another big program. I think Arkansas will be more appealing and pretty solid in 2-3 years unfortunately@austinpax With the 54th ranked recruiting class y’all couldn’t find room for a 4 Star? 🤔4 ⭐️ LB... chose us over ARKANSAS and TCU... #HailState https://t.co/jKpurLs466Yesssss https://t.co/PG6FlacWZJI’m done raging about free throws now... we got the win. 18-6... on the bubble. 4 game SEC win streak. I feel good now. #HailStateHoly... freakin crap. If we lose this game... we could’ve iced it about 4 times with free throws but we just wanna give this game awayI don’t understand how a team can be so bad at making free throws... this is so frustrating@jakedgoode @ABC7Chicago Lol I saw that man. I don’t think I’m gonna try this unfortunately because then I might be 50 pounds overweight instead of just baldThis is so awesome https://t.co/JLEf2DHHeK@jwatsonUCA how’s Philly? LolSo happy for you @CT13088 lol real fans recognize real fans #FlyEaglesFlyFly Eagles Fly!THANK YOU! You did the right thing refIf they SOMEHOW call this an incomplete pass then I will lose my mind and demand the rule be changed. The fact that this catch is being looked at is a complete jokeBut for real Justin Timberlake is amazing. He can do it allJustin Timberlake had to pick the most awkward kid in the stadium to dance with at the end of the halftime show lol@derekmadden @H_Kylin @headshotpeters_ Lolz. You wish you had moves like Lamar 😏I understand... but dang I’m gonna miss this beautiful logo https://t.co/s3QgkpOavi“Feelings cannot be trusted. Too often, feelings are based on perceptions, self-preservation, fears and emotion.” -Lisa Chan #YouAndMeForever@urbsandspices 😳🤭🤮 https://t.co/qRbpULv0heLETS GO LAMAR PETERS!!! 3 threes in a row! #HailState @headshotpeters_Number 43 for the Saints... dude. I felt like he threw the game on purpose. That missed tackle was the worst and most critical I’ve ever seenThe Greatest Showman was incredible. I would pay to see that 20 times and I’ll be buying a copy of it in a few months@derekmadden @jakedgoode No I Havnt but whatever they used it was basically throughout the entire movie. And they could’ve been eating crackers and it would’ve still been really intense@derekmadden @jakedgoode I thought Dunkirk was more stressful. It’s incredible how much more stressful music can make a scene... and they used a whole bunch of stressful sounding music 😂@jakedgoode Visually it was really good though@jakedgoode I honestly didn’t either. I wouldn’t watch again. It was constant stress and not much dialogue.@hunterwmays Redbox!I’m watching Dunkirk for the first time and I must say... I’ve never been more stressed out in my life.It looks like the SEC is just loaded from top to bottom with average to above average teams. Conference play will be interestingAfter commenting on Arkansas looking like garbage I feel that I should comment on how terrible Mississippi State looked tonight. Our offense is like watching a dumpster fireLSU is throwing entry passes to the block from NBA range... Arkansas’ defense is looking like garbage and they’re just walking around. Looks like a different team from a few weeks ago.@GJoslyn91 You wouldn’t think they would push a teams ranking back in the final poll based off of a coach leaving when you should be ranking them based off of their performance this season@AGC1281 Lol they got robbed man. Polls are a jokeBehind LSU even though we beat them 37-7... it’s cool... https://t.co/YepXyi788DOmg poor kicker. Omg I feel so sick for himOmg Georgia just run YOUR OFFENSE! Quit with this wildcat crap. So dumbRandom thought... what happens if you have an iPhone X with the whole face recognition thing but you have a twin....The more I watch this game the more I HATE Bama. These dudes are dirty@frost_zackf Yes definitely. Definitely shouldn’t have been an offsides though@frost_zackf No you can’t. I’m just pointing out the misses by these refs.These refs have just missed a false start on Bama, and instead called an offsides taking away the blocked punt then they missed a face mask call on Bama... I’m gettin heatedHe was not offsides on that blocked punt! That was hugeJalen Hurts.... dude you scrambled into pressure. I don’t understand guys that get freaked out and run out of a perfectly good pocket.#CFPNationalChampionship 

Prediction: Bama 24 Georgia 20

Go Dawgs though! Please beat Saban
