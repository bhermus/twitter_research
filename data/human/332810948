Goodbye twitter, UK basketball has put me into an indefinite hiatusLove y’all man :( @shaiglalex @iamnickrichards @KevKnox @PJWashington @quade @hamidoudiallohttps://t.co/ctn8lN39tahttps://t.co/jMQqrTGsHjSomeone needs to show them the video of Drake at Big Blue madness https://t.co/qKAWfMAk6x@MasonLanthorn3  https://t.co/cfFnJVRc6IFor once, I really hope to see @NovaMBB in the elite eight@StephenCurry30 hahahaBreakfast all day and I swear business would be boomin @ChickfilA#NewProfilePic https://t.co/xCZYBDK6RIKentucky Sports Radio knows what’s up. L’s Down @KySportsRadio https://t.co/v9cfWT6XwvDevin freakin Booker https://t.co/z87vJfXOJmHappy 5th bday and happy V Day to my homegurl Simba https://t.co/lmwEptoBF0I’ll never understand how UK basketball is tied for the most 1st round picks in this upcoming NBA draft and the team is soooo bad at times@drpepper plz sponsor meI find it entertaining to comment unpopular opinions on sportscenter Instagram posts to get some random angry repliesUK basketball is a memeThis dude is 40 and without best two wide receivers. What kind of water they got up in Boston https://t.co/tIMajE6Tx5@_A1Tate Almost man, almost hahahaPats get ball down 8 points with around 1:05 left, score and convert 2 pt conversion, and win in overtime again@MasonLanthorn3  https://t.co/xs115FLOk8@MasonLanthorn3 If something is moist, then it’s wet. Water isn’t moist, or wet@MasonLanthorn3 Lol you’re one of those guysWater isn’t wet“UK playing at home versus Vanderbilt! It’ll be an easy win!”

UK basketball: https://t.co/46W06VdFMP@cwh_231 @overtime @MELOD1P @ZO2_ @bigballerbrand GET SOME MERCH!!!@AlecDK It’d be very difficult for them to revamp the football. It just doesn’t seem like either team is interested, just fans. I hope it happens for our sake of watching it, but honestly there’s been like no progress there@AlecDK But I want some entertainment from WV. There’s nothing to compete for in WV sports@AlecDK It’d be great for the state, that’s all I’m saying. That’s all my tweet was about, as fans and people of WV. Only D1 teams in state, let’s play some sports. Make it entertaining for the people. I know my argument is biased, and you can show me how “not good” it is@AlecDK I don’t understand why they don’t schedule anymore. Seems like a good idea and experience for Marshall basketball. And would produce a great environment in Huntington as well as Morgantown@AlecDK I can definitely see the point in football, especially when you have a conference schedule that is already tough enough. FCS games are a good lock to have, just as a fan I like seeing those types of games such as MU/WVU@AlecDK Maybe a little bias here, but it’s funny how the Marshall and WVU rivalry came to a stopping point when Marshall was becoming a competitor in both sports. Basketball in Charleston was always entertaining, football was slightly getting better@AlecDK I feel as if a passionate WVU fan would like to think that Marshall wouldn’t be too challenging. Doesn’t have to be football either. Let’s play some basketball@AlecDK Very true, but that could be a valid argument for a good number of rivalry matchups that are still played. That rivalry adds a little flare to competitiveness in sports in WVMe when I see Kevin Knox on the way to my 10 am on Monday https://t.co/idq96yKebJDon’t burn all those couches tonight!! Jevon Carter will need one to sit on and watch Kevin Knox in the NBA next yearWVwho?If there’s one thing that sports needs, it’s the WVU/Marshall rivalry. There’s nothing that gets the whole state of WV more excitedProfessor asks us to google our names for fun: “What showed up on google?”

Horrible loss. https://t.co/2Y3b549ToWCavs in 7!!! https://t.co/pPO3MKxvoX@dannyharbert Kobe won’t be as close to MJ as LeBron@dannyharbert LeBron has played more games than Jordan even sitting out games lol. Look at year 15 for each of them, LeBron’s prime is the longest ever@dannyharbert I think people are scared that someone is testing Jordan’s greatness. People don’t get this heated about Kobe vs MJ... you’re just a little too worried LeBron might dethrone him@dannyharbert Kareem is the most accomplished player ever, he isn’t the best player ever. That’s great for MJ to play through the flu. Don’t ever say Steph is a better team player than LeBron, that’s just downright wrong.@dannyharbert You probably won’t even give this the time of day because it explains the better PLAYER... but if you’re a man of statistics (baseball coaches usually like statistics) you’ll watch it

https://t.co/bpEDziuyiI@dannyharbert Also, LeBron is the most durable player EVER. That’s not even worth arguing, it’s a fact. Plays at the highest level and never gets injured *knock on wood*@dannyharbert LeBron is a better all around player than either of them. He can score whenever, has more assists, and more rebounds per game. MJ averages 3 more points career because he averaged 3 more shots per game. Plus LeBron would be better at baseball... you’d want him on your team@dannyharbert If you’re trying to limit the HOF players on a team, how about the Miami Heat? It’s LeBron and D Wade and occasionally Chris Bosh when he’s not hurt... Mario Chalmers and Udonis Haslem don’t bring much to the table there@dannyharbert Lol your argument for Pau Gasol and Derek Fisher not being in the hall of fame is that Derek has to be able to guard some of the best guards ever and Pau can’t guard? I’m sure he provided a little bit in the Lakers championships@dannyharbert Derek Fisher and Pau Gasol are both hall of famers@TravisAustinWV @dannyharbert Okay so LeBron has had to play arguably the best team ever in the NBA in 2015 &amp; 2016. He won one of them... and then that team goes and adds Kevin Durant. Rebounds, assists, triple doubles, leads almost every statistic in playoff history. MJ would need people to beat the Warriors@TravisAustinWV @dannyharbert I’d like to think the people guarding LeBron nowadays are more athletic and the majority are better basketball players than whoever guarded Jordan. LeBron hasn’t lost in the opening round of a playoffs, and he took a team with Anderson Varejao as the 2nd best player to the ECF@dannyharbert How is MJ the better player than LeBron? You can’t say rings, because that makes Bill Russell better than Jordan@dannyharbert You’re a firm believer that LeBron isn’t as great as Jordan aren’t you@dannyharbert Woah, Steph is maybe the 3rd best player in the NBA. LeBron is easily #1 and then it’s either him or Durant. No debate about the best— LeBron@dannyharbert I don’t wanna diminish WVU, they should be top 3. Haven’t lost since A&amp;M, will get more ranked wins (very likely against kentucky), I’m just saying for a future career in basketball Trae Young is definitely the person you want to be@dannyharbert I wouldn’t consider many NBA arenas to be hostile in regular season games. Dude still dropped 29 points on Jevon, or whoever else guarded him. 32% is not where you’d expect him to be, but everyone claims Steph is the best shooter ever and he will still shoot 32% or worse@dannyharbert Jevon isn’t in any mock draft anywhere. Trae is a top 5, if not top 3, lottery pick. Realistically, a loss in January @ WVU versus juniors and seniors isn’t a game you expect a 19 year old to win@AlecDK I agree he strapped him on a couple plays, but he also dropped 29 points. I’d imagine LeBron guarding just about anyone would be a nightmare for that person. Top 5 draft pick, they’re giving high expectations for him by labeling him as next Steph.. The dude is younger than us@QnAllThings I know, Trae Young being a guaranteed lottery pick and Jevon not getting drafted is 120% wrongI’d still 110% rather be Trae Young than Jevon Carter any day lol@samaulick @Michael_Wentz15 Mike, if Bama played ANYONE in the nation, they would be favored to win by Vegas odds.Can I get an age confirmation on Joel Berry? I started high school when this dude started collegeU of (taking) L’s https://t.co/liUgXO1PQnGot me some Kevin Durant’s in the stocking this year 👀🐍 https://t.co/AqMJtOcZZJMerry Christmas to everyone except anyone involved with the UCLA basketball programExclusive video footage of bitcoin’s stock https://t.co/Rsm5av61gu@Tarheel_Sports_ @RossBr7813 Yeah, I definitely see the argument. They say a catch is technically two feet and a “football move.” So possibly the knee is two feet and him turning is a football move. Debatable though@RossBr7813 Completely agree. Once that ball crosses the goal line it doesn’t matter if he lets go of it, he’s already got the touchdown https://t.co/Ql4XKj6teBI couldn’t tell you what is and what isn’t a catch nowadays in the NFL, it’s different every timeEveryone’s experienced that one burp when you think you’re full, but then you burp and you’re hungry again@LZban @gsub1k3 @kbryanttt When you’re under the water the water molecules are around you, when you get out of water the molecules attach to you. You’re wet once you get out, not under@Jmt3__ @KentuckyMBB Yeah, 4 lottery picks and 6 people drafted overall. It didn’t turn out well for them at all@chip_sweeney3 @a_ratcliff13 Sometimes ya win by 2, sometimes ya lose by 2 https://t.co/3LyKRGCjNAStarted the coaching career out 0-1, but who’s counting.
