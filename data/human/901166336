THAT POOR CATFISH HAD A LOVING FAMILY WITH CHILDREN #DeleteYourAccount https://t.co/ppygwkuc7hNot sure if this is rush hour on 70 or arca at Dega. 🤔 https://t.co/GxSHHnVhHDAfter 10 hours of driving to pick up parts today and 8 hours in the shop tonight, it’s finally time to rest up to wheel tomorrow. #RoadWarriorThere’s nothing more ignorant than when an instructor blames a class for not trying hard enough when half the class fails an exam.@TheOrangeCone I think his driving has been the joke latelyBeing the highest scoring lefty and not breaking the top 40 out of 60 entries is a joke.Contemplating teaching myself how to bowl right handed considering tournament directors think it’s okay to put out patterns that shut out the left side.The only tire rule there should be in racing is that they have to be roundish.These foul calls are absolutely ridiculous@CanadianboyKcco @NASCARONFOX  https://t.co/NDgZsz0uAM@NASCARONFOX 👟
🍆Low key thought #twotwo was gonna squirrel into all 3 of them https://t.co/6C7nuPvLRV@jakehagopian Thanks Jake, hope you’re doing well manWorking out in the shop alone today was probably the most difficult thing I’ve ever gone through. I just can’t seem to do things as well as he did out there... but I’m trying and I hope he’s proud of me for it.I really don’t see what the big deal is. Student athletes are constantly taken advantage of by universities. 3k is almost half a years worth of rent so I really can’t blame him for doing it. https://t.co/PhZG9Y3xtp@JohnLeeHFP @ryoung99 @RossWece He runs an outlaw schedule which means he runs what races he wants whenever he wants to run it. He isn’t confined to one series or class of sprint car racing.People watch cbs sports? https://t.co/UyOtYJyJBZI’m just selling t shirts down I-70 tonight #SlideOrBeId https://t.co/mHZfaDq4AnLol @ARCA_Racing@JoshBrown300  https://t.co/yw4adDpGmTI find it funny people basically have to pay Toyota to not only run heir engines but use their logos too #ReverseSponsoring@ProfessorOwen  https://t.co/yB1yDvyBak@ProfessorOwen How does this workYo @Wendys have you ever thought about sponsoring a racecar? You can pay in frostys and baconators instead of money@JoshBrown300 https://t.co/jPGZjTvMXl@WARSprints @BellRacingUSA @Lucas_Oil Belle Clair, Jacksonville, Haubstadt@JoSwindell Bad parents will always be the problem@ceracing65 @Ghenneberry47 @StLouisAutoShow @GatewayKartplex @GatewayMSP @IndyCar @BommaritoAuto  https://t.co/83AyXjfGey@Mattm_9m Happy for you man, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity.

At the Daytona 500 you basically automatically qualify to make the race, then 30 cars to proceed to crash out. Honestly to win that race you just have to stay clean and beat 9 cars.@TheRealB_OHara @Lil__Wig @jjolly74 @KyleLarsonRacin I’m not, I’m just baffled by how wrong your thought process is .@TheRealB_OHara @Lil__Wig @jjolly74 @KyleLarsonRacin So basically since most of the professionals at the chili bowl can’t afford 10 million dollar rent a rides like most of the nascar field they aren’t professionals 🤔This tweet literally just gave me aids of the eyes. https://t.co/nNvvAXwdJC@ceracing65  https://t.co/iVdFVxKDGM@TulsaShootout where’s the defending champions provisional?Car low @hankdavis42 https://t.co/36HeXBpjBRHere’s a good debate.

Step 1: Be famous
Step 2: Get your GED
Step 3: Have enough money for schools to nickel and dime you to death
Step 4: Every major university in the country will be all over your twitter account if you say you want to learn something. https://t.co/pjf1u7fMEd@Ja_SS_on https://t.co/xAQuvHQ1Em@JGress14 You don’t.@hannahrussell23 I’ve just been mega busy, this semester is not easy lol@hannahrussell23 I do my best 😂😂@hannahrussell23  https://t.co/8c0YXmEB6iLife is kicking me in the butt today.

It’s a traveling snack bar. https://t.co/HoNzXWwQqE@KeithKunz @USACNation Honestly, I don’t think it matters what kind of cars they’re in. You could put them in hobby stocks and it’ll be the same guys not clearing passes and driving over people.I’ve been awake for 24 hours. Shoutout to group projects that turn out to be projects just done by me@KJHolley25 Nope, not if you find someone dumb enough to pay for it.The dumbest part about chili Bowl is the amount of people who are willing to pay over 6 grand to go out and run in the back of a C or D feature for $0.@OneDirt And when you get the tire bill back you realize you left all your money out there too. #SayNoToRubberPeople will go where they are welcome, but are more likely to return where they are appreciated.@bullethq_botty  https://t.co/Sxa1UCexyYOnline financial accounting is by far the worst business course offered by WSUSometimes I wish I would have amounted to something other than an irrelevant driver in an irrelevant form of motorsports...@Ronnie_Gardner  https://t.co/GwpDzFAh6v@pkligerman Sick laptop stand though@JoshBrown300 @Asorge26 😭😭😂@JoshBrown300 Thanks famPreview of this years tulsa shootout b features https://t.co/297GpusQZL@JoshBrown300 @Asorge26 I am now a slight fan of the golden knights 😂😂*every single person in the class bombs the exam*
