The band-aid game? @KingJames“Education is a Human Right. We will NOT give up the fight.” @DignityinSchool #MNLeg https://t.co/mzSJOU16mmAs representative @Cmarianirosa explained, our population of teachers of color in MN being 4% hasn’t changed for 30 years. As our society continues to grow diverse, we need teachers in schools that represent the student body to have more perspectives that are diverse. #MNleg https://t.co/AbMpNOZs2OGood luck to my little brother @MrShowtime_SB25 on his first Spring Game!

@KyrieIrvingI’ve got the #Celtics, who’s your pick? https://t.co/80Yh8E7Zu1@JamesLawson35 Haha!Which is worse?Thats Game. https://t.co/e5NNgZcwDlGame Over.@JRemyMo No debate here. 😎@JRemyMo Stop and Score and its a game. Eagles Score at the Start, its over.@JRemyMo Totally Agree, which is very doable.Everything that's happened to the Vikes so far, is fixable. And the Eagles are damn near playing a perfect game.@JRemyMo I did. 😂😂😂@JRemyMo We'll see. 1st 5 minutes of 3rd Qaurter at the start will determine this game.The pressure is getting to them. They need to calm down at Halftime. They playing tense.@UndreTheGiant Too bad he's inactive. 😦@JRemyMo Wait a minute now.That's a literally Perfect Drive.@JRemyMo @nicholas_moen He also made some clutch throws though.@nicholas_moen @JRemyMo I agree, but he did what he was suppose to. Haha@nicholas_moen I care. James Harrison just had a fumble sack with 4 minutes left to put the Jags in a 3rd and Long! Haha@nicholas_moen I just think it's unfair to say that they will be worse than these other teams or just as good due to the other teams and them getting there QB's right. Let's not forget, Black Bortles got it right before Carr, Mariota, Alex Smith who's been going on 10 years, Andrew Luck, etc.The only thing that is going to be annoying about this Vikings and Eagles game is that Joe Buck and Troy Aikman are the  commentators.@JRemyMo They'll be back, that defense flies around. And Blake Bortles isn't that bad, fam.@nicholas_moen I don't believe so. Andrew Luck is suspect, the Titans and Texans are going to be better, but Deshaun Watson and JJ Watt are coming off devastating injuries, not to mention, Watt is injury prone. I see them continuing because of that Defense and there Youth.Jacksonville will back again, let's be real.What a play 24!!!@VaughnSmooth What was Lamar doing? 🤧Since the Cowboys Rival is the Eagles, I have no choice but to pull for the @Vikings 😆"Who am I, the "Do or Die?" 
The one with the fewest lies 
And the Truest Ties"
Scary Thoughts 💨🌺 @DrakeHappy Birthday @destinee_23 and @Daizjah23 😊🎉Every Vikings fan, go and follow @Babymagik32 and tell him Thank You! 😁But on another note, What in the hell was #43 doing????

Score is going to be like 6-3 in one of the most boring games in Super Bowl History, just cause it's MN. 😂From unc @JRemyMo : "I hope you stub your toe and get constipated tonight."

Romo took over a trash team@DeontaeHeuer12 Excuse, has Dak won a playoff game?@TroyAikman can you please comment on this the way that you comment on @DezBryant 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/bWW0FEkS3h@DeontaeHeuer12 Uhh yeah@UndreTheGiant They did though!Tony Romo &gt;&gt; Dak PrescottHahahahahaha..

Dez Bryant is not a cancer, he just has passion. Tom Brady does the same stuff and gets praised.All I see is Passion with @DezBryant but yet again @TroyAikman and Joe Buck are going to make a storyline out of it.#NoFlyZone Boy am I going to miss u out there next year 👊🏽 https://t.co/Lt3NTLfBp5@CoachGMitchell @paichangg Happy Birthday @paichanggI told you, don't let them control you, they can't be in your shoes@VaughnSmooth @MrShowtime_SB25 A slight preview 😜Yep.. we want all the smoke 💨

Also was a distraction on the sideline, showed he quite on his team with NY Jets.In my city, with my favorite girl, ready to take on the world. 😙
