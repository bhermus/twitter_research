Also police are right outside some door per the walkie talkie i over heard too, this is how I entertain myself.I can‚Äôt be the only one who eavesdrops on people who talk on the phone in a PUBLIC RESTROOM while you pee.

If you are at the @universityofga graduate ceremony, I will be congregating with my family near the large stones outside.

About to graduate and have to do something so they don‚Äôt call me areeeaaallllia. Name is ‚ÄúAriella‚Äù pronounced (letter) R-E-L-Uh #grammarhelp #englishmajors #phdlifeThankful for a partner where I can say sincerely ‚Äúthis is all over stimulating me too much right now‚Äù and he immediately helps me take action to bring down my anxiety. Get you a partner who knows how to #love you at your best, worst, and average@WagWalking https://t.co/xB2wcr7zTZ@marquesdexter Congratulations! How wonderful :)Today my puppy literally tried to pull my sock off my foot when I wasn‚Äôt looking. #lolWhat in the actual heck is going on in this world https://t.co/S3MODGjv1FYESSSS! It‚Äôs not an exaggeration or a weakness. This is purely fact. My therapist helped me through a dark abyss of the #PhD journey, I wouldn‚Äôt have succeeded without her. #firstgendocs https://t.co/vCAoEEe9YM@firstgendocs A4. I don‚Äôt know how to answer this, so I‚Äôm just going to read responses and ponder this for awhile. Thought I would put that into words so if anyone else felt that way they would feel validated ‚ù§Ô∏è#FirstGenDocs@firstgendocs A3 (continued) I think most of people I respect most out of my graduate experience had to balance being competitive with being human. Because if they did ‚Äúcompete‚Äù, they would be left behind and possibly not achieve the fulfillment they seek post graduation. #FirstGenDocs@firstgendocs A3. I‚Äôve been sitting with this statement for a few minutes... I can think of SEVERAL times where a fellow woman was labeled as ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù, just to have a more workplace language word for ‚Äúbitch‚Äù, when they were just operating at the same level as men. #firstgendocs@firstgendocs sorry I fell behind, may have been paying a speeding ticket online.... #gotplacestobe #firstgendocs https://t.co/XgaKhiy6Cn@firstgendocs A2. Honestly? More hurtful than helpful. It really damaged my view of some of my future colleagues. I would never work with them, but helpful in the fact that the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù (or whatever) is also a competitive place. #firstgendocs@firstgendocs A1. Also, let‚Äôs be real. Humility isn‚Äôt something that is taught to everyone, which goes hand in hand with a competitive nature. #FirstGenDocs@firstgendocs *swoons at being called DOCTOR* #firstgendocs https://t.co/7tU6XsPcga@firstgendocs A1. I truly believe it‚Äôs something that has been supported by institutions and toxic culture for years. Also, a lot of high achieving academics are also prideful. #firstgendocs@firstgendocs Ariella, University of Georgia, enjoyed previous #firstgendocs chats and wanted to join this convo.@WagWalking y‚Äôall sell gift cards?Me showing up to the car repair shop on my bike to pick up my car. #phdlife https://t.co/xKIELCgG1rWait what? https://t.co/kX95mHGN3e@felicialynne I justify to myself it‚Äôs worth it every week for the terror and fear it gives me‚Äîincredible episode@felicialynne This week was rough.

If your dog is off leash, sprinting at two dog clients of mine and barking loudly, why would I assume this was a good thing? Be responsible. #ughY‚Äôall, I‚Äôm trying to make a small thank you gifts for folks at my university who were big supports (i.e. my therapist, previous supervisor, etc). Any ideas of affordable and transportable gifts? Gotta fly these across the country. #phdlife #phdadvice #phdchat@firstgendocs @BrilliantBlkGrl Yay!!!

Keep up the great work :)@drmikeographer Thanks :)also, I will never forget the most valuable lesson I learned during my PHD when my advisor sent me an article fake-accusing me of being over 50 because I put two spaces after a period. This has been a difficult transition away from the double tap. #phdlife https://t.co/6OdX6FcfjVever since passing my defense, the countdown to graduation has officially left my head.
