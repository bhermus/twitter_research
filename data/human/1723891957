4. Profit.@DustinHartAM I plan on being there, I'll definitely say hi@DustinHartAM You really need to try out the rest of the Community Patches. The upgrades to the game are stunning.Fila, who we mere mortals do not deserve, has gotten drag races to work in MTM2, and holy cow does this open the doors to some good stuff. #MonsterJam #monstertrucks #MonsterTruckMadness https://t.co/NqT2T5oiom"Shouldn't have let @Hinchtown in the car." https://t.co/TRSDS60uKa@LukeSmithF1 He led Indy last year... https://t.co/fLopUe5pQ6@Edward_Cash You should definitely pick up and say, "What time is it?

I never got to see too much past S5 unfortunately.@mwoodski The original run of RW used the old 170 lb. HW weight limit, and instead of over-built middleweights they tended to run as under-built HWs. That, and the whole idea of robot combat was still new at that point.He signed my mom, I signed his street sign, he signed my banner...do I go down the play dirty path, or...? #IndyCar https://t.co/yZQptoLidYA Miami GP but they use the Homestead road course. #F1@sarah_connors That place makes Clarks Trading Post look like Lowes Monte Carlo.@elizabeth_werth Non-NewtonianMore in ICR2.

Just don't want to get so wrapped up emotionally into them as I used to be.This Bruins game is entertaining.  But the Talladega finish will be too...I hope.@elizabeth_werth @mwoodski You're the edgelord? Your little sister looks like she's summoning Satan there.Great, now I'm caring about the Bruins againNASH VILLE!That Gatorade ad with Kane saying, "Real smooth..." that's a little...not a great look?Sounds more like Super R.C.

Why not just use the same Cup bodies down there?OK, that was cool.Quod erat demonstratum.1 lap shootout? This always ends well.ARCA 2 lap shootout?

Complaining about a restart in the rain

Where have I seen this before?

#IndyCarKimball bitching about not getting a call on being hit sure is something. #IndyCarWill too much Power for the conditions #IndyCarLike that strategy move by Simon's guys to come in there. He wasn't going anywhere at that time, so might as well gamble. #IndyCarI actually like the right down to business, no pre-race broadcasts. No fluff, get to the action. #IndyCarAll wet
And you might need a raincoat ðŸŽ¶ https://t.co/HJwk1a7ReGSo what will the bigger cluster be - Turn 1 or the hairpin? #IndyCarBarber makes me wonder why no one's tried to build a legitimate stadium-style road course before.  You'd figure you could fit a decent layout in something about the size of NHMS... #IndyCarLong way to go here, need a proper ICR2 palette, but...it has begun. #IndyCar #ICR2 @nooRok_san https://t.co/iFJA9hucTj@elizabeth_werth That's why I suggested it :-)@elizabeth_werth Actually, gives me an idea for a similar question-type article: Show me the sketchiest sponsors in racing.  I'm sure it begins and ends with Roberto Guerrero's Dianetics car, but there's gotta be more out there.@elizabeth_werth I really like the Schwan's one. I've never seen a Schwan's truck in my life, but they used to sponsor Ken Schrader, who was my dad's favorite #NASCAR driver, so I have a Schwan's car in my collection.Another year life will get in the way of going to @SupercrossLIVE at @GilletteStadium. Hopefully it's on the schedule again next year and major life events can hold off for it...Whoa #MonsterJam https://t.co/Ad2WfRDLFVTime to get to work, I guess... #IndyCar

We have a recently arrived additional family member to drag along, so it may not be super soon lol.Barber always looks gorgeous. Like racing on a golf course. Would love to head down there sometime.  You gotta be able to see, what, 50-60% of the track from the spectator area? Impressive for a road course. #IndyCar@Edward_Cash :-( Prayers...Duuuuuuuude https://t.co/WDkPlG7sceBut when can we get actual hobby grade #IndyCar R/Cs? https://t.co/ktQfwUlJfnARCA diecast?

BS

#IndyCarIs it just me or is the sound a bit tinny from the NBCSN mics? #IndyCarFull commitment.  Go hunt Rossi down! #IndyCarHOT DAMN BOURDAIS!!!!!! #IndyCar@Indycar_MN C'mon man, Pagenaud's out of the race, I don't need any more salt in the wounds...FCY TY #IndyCarThat's not Ed Jones...LMAO at De Melo holding Rossi up. Peak Coyne. #IndyCarAt least I can relax a bit watching the rest of this race...my guy is out, so I can just enjoy the on-track stuff. #IndyCarJust so frustrating when it looks like you're favorite's on track for a good weekend, and it ends before it ever really gets started. Ugh. #IndyCar@Team_Penske No this is the wrong gifFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF #IndyCarScott Pruett: "Hi to my family at home!"
Scott Pruett's family, at home: "Yeah, whatever. Pick up some toilet paper on the way back."I wonder...what is the most mundane car you could show up to one of these in and not get laughed out of the lot?

I mean, the Corvettes are really pushing it... https://t.co/bwr2zxsIu8@DLand91 Or, "12 IndyCar teams worth of funding" 1-2-3-4That's the thing about #MonsterJam too...it may appear to the uninformed to be deliberately abusing giant trucks shaped like bulls and sharks, but I like the intellectual challenge of it. https://t.co/l2cqBcoxukWhen monster truck shows are to expensive to insure to put on, garbage like this will be the reason. Use. Safety. Holds. https://t.co/YNH3CWW6cFIs it weird that I am nostalgic for the Big Dig?

(This is the most Boston tweet ever)We need to get a gallery of just the overhead shots from this corner from @IndyCar.  That angle is A++++ https://t.co/l3oPzxnEuUBaltimore was kind of the same way.  Never spent enough time around the ALMS paddock and I kind of regret that.  But the #IndyCar paddock was so much fun!Long Beach honestly feels like a weekend I would be totally overwhelmed by.  So much on track action that I'd feel bad missing it to do the paddock area stuff I love so much. #IndyCar #IMSA@DLand91 Don't give me none of your sass on this one. You knew I was talking about PWC and Stadium Super Trucks.@DLand91 It's almost like there's 2 major league racing series running there!I really hope we get a diecast of @GrahamRahal's Total car this year...that thing is niiiiice. #IndyCar.@mwoodski your typing game is here: https://t.co/x1WCtfPG97@elizabeth_werth 100 internet points if you get a selfie with him in that shirt.Personally, if #FormulaE could drop some of the game show schtick, and figure out how to run some traditional racing circuits, it'd be pretty fun.  But, right now, they're missing the mark.That major manufacturers have left other series to join #FormulaE as their primary form of racing is really a dangerous sign for the existence of other motorsports. If all the German companies pull out of DTM for FE full time...then there's no DTM, is there?One more thing that really hurts #FormulaE...all of the above is why "regular" racing fans are so virulent in their hatred of it: it is a legitimate threat to the forms of motorsport they understand and love.That @RACERmag article, too...if all the tuning is done via computer code, how are people who aren't geeks supposed to understand that? They've done a poor job at what #BattleBots is good at - teaching people basics through the competition...#FormulaEThe NY ePrix prices are a really good example of where they're going badly wrong. Needlessly high to be "exclusive", but also shutting out people who could really help grow the sport's numbers. #FormulaEIt's a problem because if #FormulaE wants to become the be-all, end-all of motorsport, it needs to appeal to those groups.  Yes, the techie, hipster crowd has a lot of money behind it, but they're not going to spend it on attending races.#FormulaE simply isn't trying to win over the traditional racing fan, not car people, not the folks attending #NASCAR, #IndyCar or #IMSA, not even really casual fans who may only watch Indy and Daytona.  And that is a problem.I didn't get to go on my #FormulaE rant a couple weeks ago, so now that I have a few minutes...Again, #FormulaE is not for the average racing enthusiast. The computer mapping, etc., is interesting in a way but it certainly isn't something that will translate well car folks who are used to suspension and engine tuning. https://t.co/CvmriDPIPRShall ride to victory lane all shiny and chrome! WITNESS!!! #IndyCar https://t.co/n5uV63ZZAU@mwoodski Very carefully...I miss going to a street circuit. Trying to watch a race at Baltimore was difficult but the atmosphere was A+++.

Again, I hope against hope for a Grand Prix of Worcester. Pit straight on Major Taylor Blvd. in front of the DCU Center. #IndyCar #IMSA@mwoodski Nightmare team is skipping this season for a different competition in China.

Which sucks, but at least I won't be setup for the inevitable disappointment this year.
