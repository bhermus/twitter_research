The lesson I learned tonight is that I need to see all of these amazing films.
Definitely an eye-opening night filled with a lot of talented people. #mssoscarsI’m actually really shocked that “Remember Me” won but every song in this category is so diverse and each song is amazing in its own way. #mssoscars@kearston She’s killing itI have been waiting for this performance all night. “This is Me” is a powerful song. Keala Settle has such a strong voice. #mssoscarsTHANK YOU for recognizing all the amazing men and women who have served and died for this country.  #mssoscarsSo happy that Get Out won. Definitely a interesting and crazy movie that raises a lot awareness of the social issues going on in the world today.   #mssoscarsDunkirk taking home another well deserved win! #MSSOscarsThe visual effects in any action packed movie always amaze me. There are some really talented people in the movie making industry. #MSSOscars“Representation matters!” #MSSOscarsBeauty and The Beast totally should have won. From the costumes, music, and set design, it’s a beautifully stunning movie. #MSSOscars@ralana37 Omg I’m in love with this 😍Dunkirk is an incredible movie. Highly recommend if you haven’t seen it. #MSSOscarsLove love love this montage of amazing movies #MSSOscarsShould have been Beauty and the Beast. But maybe I’m biased since I love anything Disney #MSSOscars@kearston Do you know something that we don’t?This is the 90th Oscars and yet they still have to remind winners to keep the speech short  #MSSOscarsYou will most definitely catch me seeing Mary Poppins Returns when it comes out 😍 #MSSOscars@theedynamicdee They all look good though, I’m gonna have to find some time to see them!!I’m the worst film major. I’ve seen none of these films 😅  #MSSOscarsLet’s see how many times politics gets brought up tonight🙄 #MSSOscars@LindaVilay Margot Robbie looks so simple but stunning!!Ugh so many beautiful and inspiring women at the Oscars tonight #MSSOscarsReady for the Oscars to start!! I’ll be rooting for Dunkirk and Get Out. Who are you rooting for?  #MSSOscarsHappy #WinnieThePooh day! 🍯 https://t.co/C1d4prqFm7Holy moly The Greatest Showman was amazing@sh_tbrookesays https://t.co/CwMyoGgabyThe one thing that The Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade fails to do every year is teach the performers to properly lip syncThe more I'm away at school, the more I appreciate spending time at homeIf this ain't toxic idk what is https://t.co/GQf0DhgDaz@knovs293 @ayahgalal @AlexaNFarrell Right above the media suiteFirst day back at school and I'm laying in bed in eating goldfish.
