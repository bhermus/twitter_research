Just a streamer and her dream #yuuiepirateI DIDNT REALIZE EREN DOESNT GET HIS FIRST KILL IN ODM GEAR UNTIL SEASON 2 IM DYINGIt’s 1pm and all I’ve done today is make and eat pancakesWe gotta learn how to love without you. We gotta carry our cross without you. Stuck in a riddle but we gotta figure it out without you. 

#RIPAviciiNetflix needs to stop making more animes and just make more seasons to ones I’m already obsessed with PRETTY PLEASE@tabathalynndots AHHHHHHHHH 😍😍😍The statement “But I thought you didn’t like-“
...just stop right there because you clearly haven’t been paying enough attention.OH HEY SORRY I FORGOT YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO EXIST I GUESS I’LL JUST FADE INTO OBLIVIONWhen a guy walks past you and he smells AMAZING but you can’t react bc you’re in publicIt doesn’t even have to take any of your time away either because you could be headed in the same direction as them and they’d have no idea just wandering around totally lost. Be a helping hand.Like we are all in this stupid, expensive, soul-crushing, dream oblitering journey together. Take them on a tour, help them find their classes, introduce them to some profs they need to know. Spare them the embarrassment PLEASEDude if somebody helped you at the beginning of college in understanding the process and answered your stupid questions without embarrassing you, pass it on. Don’t let someone else you see suffer and feel as dumb as you felt. Be a fricking good person.I wish colleges would tell you what would be required of you if you attended there. Sooooo I’m just supposed to be born with this knowledge?I want a spring break do-over.Me to me: don’t get in that turn lane  you idiot we are going straight 
Also me: *gets in the turn lane*So I kinda slept in, went to the store, and took a couples naps today and it’s only 9. Sweet.@Sentient__Moss I’m the girl in the back under the tree probably tweeting rn@Hypocrite_Taco If these people are going to misrepresent Christianity, the least they could do is find a decent verse. They took Luke 13:3 totally out of context.@DenimLumberjack notEvery time I think about abortion I think about Jesus on the cross and about how he’d done absolutely nothing bad in his entire life, yet someone decided that he had to die and that he didn’t belong among his own people.College is weird bc you never know how old anybody is.I want one of those paint by numbers so badYou,

-frustrate me
-hurt me
-used me
-pity me
-exploited my weaknesses
