Maybe run your fingers through scalp and use hair brush for ends!@Jumping_Gene Try cooling things on your head. Mustard oil should help. Try to avoid conditioner and use shampoos that are less harsh to skin. And for now- maybe try combing just the roots so you're not popping them! :)5 people followed me // automatically checked by https://t.co/CawFdB4NkCWhy so obsessed over Kylie's pregnancy?

I speak Punjabi and I am fluent in English as well. I'm proud of the fact I'm multi lingual but not because oh my lord my English is so much better than someone who was never taught any English. And even if they were, so effing what?This is the one thing that pisses me off the most. You guys create so much unnecessary hype over one thing and suddenly one language, one type of cuisine, one race somehow becomes superior. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK???Like have you heard someone talking in Urdu? How beautiful it sounds (personal opinion of course). I'd be jealous of someone who can speak/write Urdu. There are soooo many wonderful languages and each reflects its rich culture!Just because you speak English and the other person speaks their native language, it does NOT (underline) mean you're anyhow better than them in any possible way! So stfu and take your arrogant ass back to your casa! ThanksLast RT!! Yes yes yes!!!!! HOW IS ONE LANGUAGE SOMEHOW MORE SUPERIOR THAN OTHERS???

I don't think anyone can "happily let go" of a loved one.I was watching a video shared on Facebook about love vs attachment. Although theoretically it sounded amazing to love without attachment, I don't think it's practically feasible.I don't trust people who say they LOVE sushi.No more rain for rest of the week!

SmhNot inviting any heated arguments but what's the logic behind playing the national anthem in a movie theater? Like how did it even start?Something I need to remind myself time and again: Face it. Good or bad, learn to confront.@Jumping_Gene What's artificial honey?@Jumping_Gene This is true. Honey is naturally considered anti-bacterial. The pH is too low for microbe growth. And also low to no moisture and microorganism need moisture to grow!Ke jaise tujjko banaya gaya hai mere liye ❤️I hate winter sooo sooo soooo much!!!
