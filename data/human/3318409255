We can go beat Miami or USC in a new year 6 Bowl. If they win that, still a real successful season@T_Monks I think they got it wrong, but I think both teams would get rolled by Clemson@T_Monks But the first year they were right  to put OSU vs Bama and we rolled through the playoffs@T_Monks It’s a different year, and what makes you think Bama deserved it? Beating a quality team like Fresno State?@T_Monks OSU should schedule easy teams next year and play Texas. The committee says conference Championships matter but I guess they don’t@T_Monks By Bama playing an easy schedule? OSU should schedule Mercer in November next yearThat’s a Dub!

Ohio State CAN beat any team in the top 10 excluding Bama.@phaynie32 Yeah I’m watching the game. Once they lose, still lead the Big Ten and can win the big ten championship. They are a top 10 team.

Only a QB can be the GOAT and maybe, if lucky, a RB
