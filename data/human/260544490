@JUBaseball has been a complete team effort - top on down. What a crew of young guys that are putting together a special season. #JUfam https://t.co/a9prV5SIbP@TheDCLBlog All the more reason, that there MUST be some sort of walking option available around the Seven Seas Lagoon. People could get there faster by walking. @WDWNT @WDWToday@PilgrimMilitia Please keep those VBall updates coming - that’s my bro doing the coaching for those awesome boys!! #PilgrimVBall@PilgrimMilitia Hellllll yeah!!!!!!!Braxton - don’t pronounce any “r’s” in your words, and it’s all good.

Scary if this whole roster is present in August. 😳😳🤘🤘🙏🙏I am very curious how Cuse and Okla got in while OK St and SoCal got left out. Head scratchers for sure.Dear @TBSNetwork - this #MarchMadness Selection Show is hot freaking garbage. Just show the brackets already. It’s such a simple formula on how to run this show.

Not sure how you all sleep at night. What a GEM you all created in HB7055, a complete attack on teachers. We will remember this. #gutless@Ask_WellsFargo Information has been sent via DM. Thank you.HORRIFIC customer service by @WellsFargo - had a large check stolen out of the US mail, scrubbed, and cashed by a thief....then I am DENIED fraud protection.

SO proud of you @ChrisLehane21 💪💪🤘🤘#JUbaseball https://t.co/wIKDEzVkpl@miamckayvb *Publix*“Soccer players” flopping worse than Michael Jackson’s Invincible album....I’m still steamed that a great group of kids got robbed last night down in DeLand. Absolutely atrocious.@jppalmCBS @Kevin_Farrahar Where was the first leaky roof this week? @jppalmCBS@BeachSportsGuy They were diving all over the field. And the play where King Flopper “ran into the chain link fence”? Completely fake. Definitely not injured whatsoever. I feel so badly for the boys from Neptune Beach. Should NEVER have ended this way.Officiating should NEVER decide the outcome of an athletic event, but that’s what happened down in DeLand last night. Truly awful dishing out a red card, while the opposing team had King Flopper trying to get nominated for an Oscar.What a horrendous, garbage call. https://t.co/EswWvTi3jE@CFreemanJAX Garbage, trash call. Going right to the red card? @FHSAA should be embarrassed.@T5Sportswear Thank you @T5Sportswear !!!! We are on our way to States in Daytona next month - finished in 5th place today overall. Our #mathletes love our MathCounts shirts. Thank you for being such an awesome local business that supports DCPS schools. 💪👍🤘🤓😃Fletcher Middle taking on Regional @MATHCOUNTS today at UNF! #nerdherd #mathletes #FMSmathclub https://t.co/okdKl54Vv0@StrackAttack8 Awesome stuff!!@kylekipple @BeachRatSoccer Meet ya there!@CFreemanJAX @BeachRatSoccer Thank you!!! @CFreemanJAX@CFreemanJAX How’s that Home crowd @CFreemanJAX ?? I’m up here in Savannah for vball tourney.“Thoughts and prayers” are utterly meaningless until something changes. Get a clue @FLGovScott 😡😡😡😡 https://t.co/2Tep3TsCrN@SydAndrus Send me a picture of what you’re currently working on. College Alg is just a review of Alg1 &amp; 2, right?@JasonFischerFL @micahross @CordByrd @jay_fant @ClayYarborough Here comes another hammer to public education with HB 7055, drummed up by another charter school supporter like yourself, @richardcorcoran. Absolutely pitiful that teachers are treated like this. Nobody else to attack? Let’s hammer the teachers some more. Geesh. Thanks so much!@hintofspy What’s going on today? #dak@JasonFischerFL @micahross @CordByrd @jay_fant @ClayYarborough Apparently @JasonFischerFL thinks charter schools are actual public schools. When in actuality, they’re not. They keep their hand in the public pot, but have ZERO to do with the public school system. Did I miss anything? Nice try, though.
