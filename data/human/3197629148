I got a crown put on my tooth and no one told me it would feel like I got punched in the face 🙃🙃.@_cfoxx90 😂😂. Love it.@_cfoxx90 Oh yea :/ Paper Boi is going to have to start taking things seriously. I mean... damn. The episode before :/ and Earn tries... but Paper Boi needs someone that actually knows what they are doing. Earn does have bad luck, but when money is involved.. stuff like this can't happen.@_cfoxx90 You could FEEL the shame.@_cfoxx90 PUSHING THAT GIRL DOWN THE STAIRS. Then Earn trying to fight him 😂😂😂@_cfoxx90 YES!!!!!!@_cfoxx90 So dumb!!!!@_cfoxx90 when they said statesboro I died lol@_cfoxx90 OMG RIGHT???@_cfoxx90 I could cry 😭😭❤@_cfoxx90 OH MY GOD!!!!!@hannahbrosh A friend of mine is going and I'm just like.... 😭😭I really really really want to go back to New Orleans 😭.@_cfoxx90 Yes!!! And I can only imagine what kind of girl he'll end up with. Darius is one of a kind.@_cfoxx90 Oh yes. And idk :/ he doesn't seem to want what she wants.@_cfoxx90 Seriously 😂😂@_cfoxx90 Darius just pops up at the most random places lol@_cfoxx90 I died 😭😭😂Ate healthy all day... then opened up the freezer and noticed we have heath Klondike bars. There went my self control.@_cfoxx90 Ooohhhhh!!!! That's right!!!!!!!!! I like that theory!!!!@_cfoxx90 Oh dang. And dude... I thought Teddy was Bennie... BUT WHO WAS THAT AT THE END? Unless Darius was seeing stuff... but they hauled out 2 bodies...@_cfoxx90 Since that was an ode to MJ, he was robbed of his childhood. And you could tell it was the same show..  but man lol@_cfoxx90 I'm still creeped out from it lol I've told people that haven't seen Atlanta to watch that episode because it's one of the most bizarre pieces of television I've ever seen. Donald Glover is brilliant. Such a different episode from the barbershop 😂@_cfoxx90 WHEN HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING HE WOULD REALLY LOVE AND HE OPENED THAT DOOR AND YOU SAW THE OUTLINE OF A BODY I ABOUT TURNED IT. Darius....

I give these to my kids at school (they love them) so I know I won't eat the leftovers 😂 https://t.co/4NHwTZmO9EGot to meet @Writer_DG (one of my favorite authors) today at the Savannah Book Festival. She is an INCREDIBLE and hilarious speaker ❤ @Outlander_STARZ @SamHeughan @caitrionambalfe https://t.co/h1TzqNTSy6It's annoying to see people on Facebook advertise something or ask for help in/with something.. and have people comment "I would but" or "I wish I could!" THAT ISN'T WHAT THAT PERSON ASKED. WHY COMMENT IF YOU CAN'T DO WHAT THAT PERSON ASKED FOR?@cfoxx_90 Yea.. he's just weird lol@cfoxx_90 Right?? I hope this is a joke or else he needs help lol@cfoxx_90 Seriously. WTF.@cfoxx_90 It needs to happen for HUMANITY.@cfoxx_90 YES@cfoxx_90 If you yell at me to buy your cookies and you see in trying to ignore you and you CONTINUE TO YELL AT ME I WILL NEVER BUY FROM YOU.
