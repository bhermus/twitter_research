Fashion is literally one of the few things that you can actually woman-splain to most men and it makes me feel powerful afI remember a time like ten years ago when no one I knew lived in NYC and  no one knew what I was talking about re. designers and fashion events. And though my life is much easier now, I kind of miss having it all to myself.Everybody was talking about Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhardt, which we already knew about. And then like HOURS LATER we hear about Grimes and Elon Musk?!I love fashion and I love religion.
