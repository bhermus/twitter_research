https://t.co/ci3tKDIUInWynn Resorts "absolutely" considering renaming the forthcoming Wynn Boston Harbor. My prediction is they'll just use Encore branding (unless they make Elaine Wynn the new face of the company, in which case ... will they keep Wynn?) https://t.co/eWoYBz8qxPIs a comeback after disgrace possible? Interesting reporting from @kimseverson on Mario Batali's next move (if he has one). https://t.co/Y5CbeAwVStHappy anniversary, Zach and Julie!

My uber driver, who speaks perfect English, moved from India to US at 10 years old and taught himself the language watching Three’s Company and Brady Bunch reruns.@mattvillano Dude - the airport candy selection was weak. Had there been gummy cola bottles - or more importantly sour gummy cola bottles - I would have taken them down too.Hey candy makers - if you could stop writing “share pack” and “share size” on these packages of candy that I’m obviously going to eat by myself that would be great thanks https://t.co/LIm2dAaDkR@ashleyfarkas I mean, if there's any dog that deserves this, it's Bailey.Today in WTF: just ran into a couple buying cartons of coconut water for their dog because, “he doesn’t like to drink regular water.” 🐶 🥥@LisaNucci1967 @NancyLeeGrahn Amazon, Apple, Google, AT&amp;T and FedEx to name a few. https://t.co/gOK1XE5aa0This is a must watch. https://t.co/eCzdVG1ctw👇🏻 https://t.co/v95X296bhB@thomasjudd10 Did you learn nothing from our talk this morning? 😜This just made my morning. https://t.co/4Hj1EID1VOThis kid was by far my favorite part of the #PepsiHalftime show. #SuperBowl #SBLII https://t.co/cEBkCK0DCEStaying at the 🦅 team hotel where a humvee is blocking cars from entering, an armed guard escorts you into the building &amp; bomb-sniffing dogs greet you at the entrance.
