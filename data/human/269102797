There needs to be a site for People of North Dakota. 😷😳Hearing No Doubt playing in public &gt;&gt;&gt;I just don't get it.Not sure how I like iOS 10.These paychecks&gt;&gt;Well, this is awkward.I'm actually excited for my washer and dryer to be delivered.Man, SiriusXM sales people are pushy trying to sell overpriced radio. Say all you want, but it is not worth the $18 a month.Some days I can knock all my school work out within an hour or so, but then there are days like today where it is taking me hours to start.Who gave these idiots licenses?Maybe if I keep lying to myself I'll start to believe it.Shoutout and a huge thank you to the best person in the world!

They better not be sitting next to me, because having only a portion of your seat sucks.Actually not sitting next to a fat lard allowing my to sit comfortably.I love TSA Precheck! Makes going through security easy for non-terrorists like myself.Was chillin' by the pool like... https://t.co/gPgA1RoQIMI've been back in Memphis for 5 minutes and I kind of already hate the place again.

Just ruined my day.The day will get better once I'm off work.This day/week keeps getting more and more shitty.@Sharky035 sorry.I've dropped so much money this paycheck and it's only the 15th.Would have been a great night, but it'll still be good.North Dakota would be awesome if I didn't live here.Allergies going crazy today.
