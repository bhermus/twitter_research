It makes me sad. #RHONJHonestly, the #RHONJ reunion was just kinda sad.Margaret is hovering around Siggy like fly to shit. #RHONJThis cast is golden. Lydia shoving grapes in her mouth and laughing while Jackie screams down the phone at her. Award worthy. #RHOMelbourneLydia is so funny, I need gifs of her on the phone. #RHOMelbourneOmg Gina ‚Äústopping by‚Äù at Lydia‚Äôs to remove herself from the storyline Lydia created, make Lydia jealous she‚Äôs going to a party and make Lydia jealous that she‚Äôs going to Mexico. #RHOMelbourne‚ÄúVenus is 120 years old in plastic surgery years‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy have you had more work done than me?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a piece of shit.

I mean are we suprised that Ms Roach has been running her mouth? Legend.  #RHOMelbourneWe continue, this week; Gamble‚Äôs House is Haunted followed by Gamble Goes Ghosthunting. #RHOMelbourneGina is so strategic and iconic refusing to validate Lydia‚Äôs lie. Lydia is shaking.  #RHOMelbourneI didn‚Äôt realise people still got shapes shaved into their hair.Surely Melissa demanded a seat next to Andy because why would she be opposite Tre and Margaret? ü§î #RHONJ https://t.co/tWIyDQbAghI was playing Breathe by The Prodigy watching this and honestly it fits this video perfectly https://t.co/jdsMPOUu5GSKINNY LEGEND https://t.co/7Swi8ri9Ls@MzChelleowell @Bravotv @KenyaMoore  https://t.co/08ghbTLZPHMarlo is hilarious. #RHOA https://t.co/HjVWfnIa5eCynthia hired Will, right?

The reveal of her secret singing career that was ruined 20 years ago because she went deaf in one ear... What a legend. #RHOMelbourneJackie and Janet during the lunch with Sally is comedy gold. #RHOMelbourneI do not care for Venus, her sister, or the contrived story of lies they‚Äôre pushing. Keep it. #RHOMelbourne@MTVMusicUK @britneyspears  https://t.co/FcOlO0D3ot‚ÄúHi, my name is Rain.
