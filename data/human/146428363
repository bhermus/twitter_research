It could also do with somebody pointing out to the petitioner that the state doesn't own your kids. https://t.co/V8sYeBHDo5@jaCattell @OneTeamGov I think at this point it's too big for pitches on the day.

Just, it has all the charm of an SMS client, not a n internet age messaging tool.@symroe I think WhatsApp is fine. It's easier to use than Signal (I think). Just that Twitter seems to be having another "just/only use signal" moment.(also, I like to use an app that at some stage has thought about user journeys and balanced security with usability rather than being digital cod liver oil)The very idea of "just use signal".

If you're not then I will also book you for "driving with my eyes shut saves moisture". I can't for the life of me understand why while working in the data business you'd argue for needing less in making business decisions.@thomasforth @puntofisso Fair enough, I've mostly heard of you in relation to the Open Data Institute which may be where confusion crept in.@thomasforth @puntofisso and especially in the "open"/"civic" sector it feels as though a lot of tools exist because we like building tools rather than meeting user needs (or demonstrating that needs exist). I appreciate that there is no perfect answer for this.@thomasforth @puntofisso but: if something is worth coding then it is probably worth researching too. Building off user needs and testing regularly doesn't have to be expensive (other than possibly in time), but it often prevents spending time doing the "wrong" thing.@thomasforth @puntofisso I've seen a bit of this recently with charities. Any research is better than no research, and thinking of ways to share and scale research between orgs with low budgets is vital. Framed like that rather than "this is critical national infrastructure" might elicit better responsesFor the first time in my life yesterday I had a conversation with somebody who had *the exact same idea* for lords' reform as me. https://t.co/01p7pcwEQK@thomasforth @puntofisso Yep: I suppose just echoing Giuseppe's question: if the research is surveys with an already engaged audience, do you have confidence that that is the best representation of the data for all and do you have other approaches that you found less useful?@thomasforth @puntofisso I get that budgets are hard. I was just asking cause you said you'd done loads and it is an interesting problem on visual representation.@thomasforth @puntofisso I'm doing some stuff on people's understand of democracy at the moment, I'd love to see the research if you can publish an anonymised version?@stamanfar Ha!
