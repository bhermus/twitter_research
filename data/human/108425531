You gotta love Shoreditch Park. People out sunbathing in Speedos. #budgiebeingsmuggled@TKMaxx_UK why on earth would you have your over door heaters on full blast in your Westfield Stratford store when it is 24 degrees outside. It’s a waste of energy and surely a waste of money. TURN THEM OFF!Oh I wish you hadn’t said that... 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/dMGCGm91L0Drunk song of today: 
We won the league, at Shite Hart Lane. We won the league at Shite Hart lane. We won the league... at the shithole. We won the league at shite Hart Lane! 🎵🎶🎵To Michelle on @bbc606, I’m an Arsenal fan, and they are my local team. Not all fans of big clubs support them because they are a big club. Don’t generalise.@DWSportsNews @OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC I’m not going to perpetuate this ridiculous argument you seem to want to continue, just because your a fan of one of the two clubs.@DWSportsNews @OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC Exactly. Won the game. Period.@DWSportsNews @OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC So if a team wins a cup final on penalties it doesn’t count that they won the game? How ridiculous! 😑@DWSportsNews @OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC I’m not taking away your performance mate, chill out.@DWSportsNews @OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC As I’ve already said. If you add that as a caveat to the stat fine, and since I don’t bet I wouldn’t know that. And anyway, if you win a match on penalties you still win the match. So saying Arsene never beat port vale or Rotherham is wrong.@adamrutter42 @OnlyMyGee @OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC 1. That’s fine if you add that caveat. 
2. I don’t bet so Why would I know that.@DaveBailey1876 I’m sorry what does referencing Highbury have to do with the content of my tweet?@Rylan What a bitch.@OptaJoe @acffiorentina @PAOK_FC @PSG_English @OfficialPVFC @OfficialRUFC Since when does winning a game on Pens not count as winning the game? The Rotherham game in 03 and the Port Vale game in 98 we’re both won by Arsenal on pens. So this stat isn’t exactly true is it?How different this @Starbucks scene in Miss Congeniality would have been if she could have just used her app. https://t.co/RrL36jYjla@MustafiOfficial and @PetrCech sort yourselves out or bench yourselves. FED UP OF YOUR NONSENSE AT THE BACK!Why has this closing ceremony now been turned into some sort of feminist message. #goldcoast 😑That Birmingham video at the #CommonwealthGames closing ceremony did nothing to make the world think Birmingham was a nice place; made it look like it was dirty and people were rude and rough. Wiping snot on someone on the train... WTF?!Prepare yourself @RobHolding95... gonna have to do your thing again. #COYG https://t.co/NSzj10RBx4@signorbump I’m trying to find some sort of positive 😩😭😂@signorbump Can we say better over 2 legs than a 1 off? 🤨Anyone tries to say they don’t know what Granit Xhaka does for Arsenal. Look what happens when he doesn’t play in that midfield. No structure.@TomPapaloizou Maybe, but I do think all this contract nonsense is really affecting things.Playing jack Wilshere in his current form is worse than playing with 10 men.@KyleLangford_96 is by far my favourite track and field althlete. Comes second and is fuming, always wants to do better. Too many GB athletes are content with minor results. Keep going mate, you will get there with that attitude! 👏🏼👏🏼The Mark Hughes effect on Southampton... violent conduct.@LeroyDGRosenior are you a fan of #fredsavsyed ... since you are often mentioned? 😂FED UP OF ALL THIS DAMN RAIN NOW. SOD OFF!Absolutely buzzing for @IanJamesPoulter CONGRATS MATE! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼These ‘handshakes’ are so embarrassing, something we all did... but in primary school, not as adults! 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/bDGvIkuWRRAnd unlike the men, the women actually do well in the big competitions! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/89AVmMBDHtGo-No-Go assessment of walking up the escalator after leg day... NO GO.When you know your already getting DOMS and this is how you will be leaving work today... https://t.co/vry9LgO4v9@beamkamp @Stuart_PhotoAFC Hahaha you’re so angry! You have no idea about affiliation and what supporting a team means...@beamkamp @Stuart_PhotoAFC No real Arsenal fan can just ‘support Chelsea sometimes’... next you’ll tell me you sometimes support those dirty spuds.@beamkamp @Stuart_PhotoAFC Don’t think you quite understand what it means to have rivals...Imagine if someone made a shirt that said ‘kiss me I’m white’... there would be outrage! 😑 https://t.co/wzbz5VBaQE@TomPapaloizou 🤬🤬🤬One thing is for sure, Don Draper would never have okay’d that stupid Bud Light advert. Makes me certain I will never buy or drink it! So bloody annoying.@Spinningbackfis It says in your bio that you are an Arsenal fan, so how about you recognise Casey Stoney (former @ArsenalWFC player) and don’t be so rude!More proof he’s a complete crackpot! https://t.co/xUIiivRLNTNice one by Jose... talking about the clubs you previously managed that knocked the club you now manage out the champions league in previous years. 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/xggBRVLuqHAlexis unquestionably has a lot of talent but his personality required football to be an individual sport and 10 other people not doing things his way is why he eventually moves on. https://t.co/2PB67Ak5as@johnsonxl88 @Robbmik @aaroncapstick @66telecaster What has my team affiliation got to do with it? 😂 hollow argument...I really hope stores in the UK aren’t going towards an American style service. If I need help I’ll ask, let me look for myself.@aaroncapstick @66telecaster If it’s the passenger who did it then why should the driver be banned? 🤔@CarolineHirons karaoke has now made me listen to both Whitney and Carrie Underwood so far this evening...@arseblog Only if he WANTS to be at Arsenal. Which I think he does.He’s sat on the other side of the tube but he’s still kicking me! Hope he meant to get off 20 stops ago! https://t.co/QpEDXpmN1jBet Szczesny is BUZZING.#ForzaJuve@GaryLineker how do you feel about @LAYS being advertised at Wembley rather than @walkers_crispsLOVE that from Chiellini on Alli.Why is it not more embarrassing for football players who get the tiniest of knocks and go down screaming like they’ve just been shot?2 additional assistants and they STILL don’t see a stone wall pen on Costa! #TOTJUV@GlennHoddle Of course a rugby player wouldn’t go up to a rugby referee and shout at him like that. But a rugby referee demands respect because they don’t usually ruin matches and they get their decisions right!Thought security in France might have been a bit better given events IN PARIS a few years ago. https://t.co/ipTEUmEbm7Can’t believe how frustrating it is that the woman in the Green and Blacks advert breaks of PART of a square of chocolate. 🤦🏻‍♀️Why is it only a decision for the ref if Ronaldo makes contact!? If the INTENT was there surely it doesn’t matter... @btsportfootballDisgusting and so disappointing that a fair few of those fans at #PSGRM couldn’t be silent for 1 minute as a sign of respect for the death of a player.@PlayersTribune Hopefully he found a pair of shorts.@paulyboym1 @SAMorfett @lynseyhipgrave1 Go back and read my first two tweets again.@paulyboym1 @SAMorfett @lynseyhipgrave1 Inflection. If you don’t understand how those words can be used in both an endearing and patronising ways you’re never going to understand.@paulyboym1 @SAMorfett @lynseyhipgrave1 I’m listening and can hear it. And unfortunately men speak to women like this all to often; especially when it comes to football. I get it all the time and it’s boring now. I know just as much as most, if not more, and have just as valid opinions as a man.@paulyboym1 @SAMorfett @lynseyhipgrave1 Different word but exactly the same inflection and intent.@paulyboym1 @SAMorfett @lynseyhipgrave1 So why, when she pulled him on it and asked him to stop speaking to her like that, did he persist in continuing?Look in a mirror and you might find something dummer. https://t.co/S2rpIy9LZSProperly chuffed that @lynseyhipgrave1 stopped that patronising sorry excuse for a man for further showing people how not to speak to a woman! https://t.co/b4ybDCxBYW@cityzencentre @442oons More suited to Barca with all the fraud...Players have to be making some sort of protest against the manager.Glenn Murray better toughen up a bit if he’s gonna get banged up!Can someone explain why kits between teams have to be completely different (down to the socks) but the referee can have exactly the same socks AND shorts as one of the teams. Pretty sure Arsenal have passed to the ref at least 3 or 4 times so far. #BHAvAFCHonestly, why the hell did we sell @13Szczesny13 and leave this mug in goal.@matthewsyed Homophobia and the complete lack of openly gay players in football/male sport in general. Love to hear @RobbieSavage8 view on it and why people can’t come out and don’t come out, even after they retire.Our club is a bloody shambles.@steph7_7 Okay, sounds good x@steph7_7 I’m assuming male ones? I hope things get sorted anyway!@steph7_7 I’m okay, what about you? 😔@steph7_7 Hope you’re okay 😘@waitrose I do not expect to be in one of your shops 5 minutes before it closes and have the fridge shutters closed infront of my face and the lights turned off. What sort of service is that. Won’t be going in there again if that’s how you treat paying customers.Wigan just love beating Manchester City in the Cup... 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼The phenomenon at the North Police... https://t.co/BsNjA1rvIw@thameswater What have you told me in this tweet that I didn’t already know? I never asked you what the problem was or why I was being delayed. I am fully aware of that. My point was that it’s about the 6th time in 2 years that you’ve dug up the same strip of road. It’s utterly ridiculous.Can not believe Dele Alli is getting away with these dives every game. An absolute embarrassment to the game of football. #RAFCvTHFC@thameswater Shouldn’t you already know where you’re doing work? Specifically considering I named the road.@thameswater need to sort out Muswell Hill Road once and for all. For years now they have been digging it up and ‘fixing the issue’ only to dig it up again a few months later. Fed up of being stuck on the bus for ages in a queue or being diverted round the houses.@DFletcherSport used to be alright as a commentator, now he chats complete utter tripe and exaggerates absolutely everything as if all life on earth is about to end. Get off your power trip, you ain’t all that.Really got the London off my face tonight. @GarnierFR Micellar water followed by @RENskincare Cleansing Balm and finally @NuxeUK Reve de Miel cleanser. CLEANSED. https://t.co/hVmUYmrn5qHow can you be an Arsenal team in the NLD and not put in a load of strong challenges. Get in their faces. Talk shit to them.Bellerin seemed the only player really grafting.I’m so disappointed that nobody seemed bothered, nobody seemed up for it, and nobody seemed to take control and lead. Thought Jack would have been getting everyone right up for it but it just wasn’t the case.Firmly believe that defensive problems are partly down to a lack of trust and belief in a goalkeeper. Petr Cech does not instill confidence in anyone.Was anyone actually up for the game?!?!Alexis is a little bitch.@signorbump This will be me once I finally leave the pub... 🙄😂Take a bow... WHAT A GOAL. 👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/4W5cop92eZWhat sort of meaaage does this send out? Because you’re not in the spotlight it’s acceptable to violently attack someone... it’s not like it was a strong tackle, he literally tried to choke him from behind. Appalling decision @fa https://t.co/WtJkl9qmTITANK. https://t.co/kN6Vha2T1UFinally @leedsrhinos got an away win at Warrington. What a game from Jack Walker and that try from @Ryan5Hall 👌🏼 #SuperLeagueWhen you see @bbcsport_david has tweeted and it says Ozil signed a new deal! https://t.co/T8BQrMKVerAlways get a cuddle from #gunnarsaurus when I walk in to the screening! ☺️@KantoLamin @trevorsdempster @OsmanZtheGooner If Chelsea want him how can West Ham not want him with a liability like Carroll@trevorsdempster @OsmanZtheGooner Well why can’t he go to bloody West Ham! Gahhhhh!@arranhtfc @AlexScott @ArsenalWFC You are so ignorant.Nice one @CostaCoffee lorry, blocking up Muswell Hill parked on a double yellow... 👍🏼 https://t.co/M7cYACcVRtTrying to figure out if Steve McManaman is Blind or Biased or both... https://t.co/aTI3Zh3pJwJon Champion inferring Andre Marriner either has a drink problem or is unprofessional enough to be drinking during half time when he has a job to do... nice one @btsportfootball@bet365 BRADFORD at the Bridge! 😂If I hear one more person talk about their set up at home to mine bitcoin I’m gonna scream. 🤦🏻‍♀️@Joe_Teddy @ElNennyM @HenrikhMkh Support is not defined as how many drums and how loud can you be ya know!Big respect to @DionDublinsDube for speaking so well, and showing true feelings, about what Cyrille Regis meant to him and the footballing community. True men show their feelings! 👍🏼😘@ArsenalWFC please start putting the scores the correct way round based on home and away teams. It’s so confusing that you put that we won 3-2 but we’re the away team.Every referee is going to give every 50/50 decision (and those which clearly aren’t 50/50) against us now. Although we don’t deserve to win today it doesn’t mean these big game decisions aren’t completely wrong and its going to happen every game.2018 is MY year.Me when someone tells me all their Friday night plans while I’m holed up at home with a heat pack on my back! https://t.co/FkFz21WTzV@UKPowerNetworks no power since 6am in North London.

The argument is now (sort of) valid. 😂@mdotc223 @mufc19861986198 Fair enough... Except he didn’t actually play in that tournament where they won it? 🙈@mdotc223 @mufc19861986198 Well that’s just bull 😂@arseblog I think you spelt season wrong@mufc19861986198 Not like Mustafi won the World Cup or nothing... 🤦🏻‍♀️😂@Carra23 comments on Monreal about the last 2 years of his career are so disrespectful! What have Liverpool won in those 2 years?@ Finchley Central and there has been 4 trains to Mill Hill East and NONE to High Barnet. WHAT THE FRIDGE @northernline ?!?!I know this is the Arsenal game but this is passion.
