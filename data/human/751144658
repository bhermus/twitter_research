When I heard the song at first, I didn't process it well until this shii happened.I was going to extend a job offer to a random student today. After explaining to the first girl I met, she said she didn't understand me at all and we should talk after her lecture. I met a guy few minutes later and I didn't land before he grasped what I was driving at.@ishananxyli @Bhadoosky That's the price celebrities pay for being famous. She could have stayed at home if she didn't want people to pry into her affairs. Who knew one Nina existed before the show?@gtbank  I was at your branch at Onipanu on Wednesday to reactivate my GTB account and also to link my BVN to my account.
