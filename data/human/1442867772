Just pointing it out. I also think it's difficult to make gin manufacturers responsible for finger print scanners. The same security settings on your phone are optionally provided to you, not mandated.@anamchara32 This would effectively do nothing against the Las Vegas shooter.@vagabundomg @Drunkwithpower9 That's a different argument. I saw that reddit thread. Playing against the UW control decks, you still have hope. Maybe they don't have a counter etc. Lantern hard locks you and it's much clearer when to concede.@vagabundomg @Drunkwithpower9 A player throwing their hands up asking if it's okay to concede in front of 100k+ ppl because it's going to take his opponent 20 turns to kill him and knowing he can't do anything isn't good for coverage.@vagabundomg @Drunkwithpower9 Would you day Gerry didn't know how to play against it? That wasn't great coverage. Your not wrong. It's Magic, there's always lines. Doesn't mean it's good for the game/Wotc.@Drunkwithpower9 @vagabundomg Sure, but it's just a different type of miserable.@Drunkwithpower9 @vagabundomg Also isn't exactly great for coverage.@Drunkwithpower9 @vagabundomg Sorry yeah. Those. I don't have issues with a prison deck, but I could see it getting banned for the same reason eggs was. It just takes forever to win and isn't fun to play against at all.@Drunkwithpower9 @vagabundomg 7th and 8th Edition are the real problem.@vagabundomg @anamchara32  https://t.co/JvCo7mAsd8@vagabundomg @anamchara32 Why are you confused?@vagabundomg @anamchara32 Your*@anamchara32 @vagabundomg This is why I've never been to the pro tour.
