@VULNERASANENTVR He stopped his mind from working for a second and took the outstretched hand, his body rising to follow his boyfriend.

Sitting down and pulling Nova down with him Cain gave a tired sigh, body too thin to do anything more than sleep.@VULNERASANENTVR much money as we can in. Why don't you get some sleep and I'll come home as soon as I can okay?"

He would most likely be declined work tonight due to his tired and weak status, his fingers combing through Nova's hair again as he stood to rise.@VULNERASANENTVR Nova was right the constant dark clouds over their heads were depressing.

Cain was doing his best but his best wasn't good enough lately, slowly he pushed the plate away not having eaten much.

"Rowan and Luca sent us money. They want us to visit them in Italy..."@VULNERASANENTVR Brows rose at the force used to make him sit, his eyes wide at the stern command from Nova's lips.
