"This is what you need to know.. 
Flu shots come once a year. Flea medicine comes once a month. And birth contol comes once a day."I'm just bursting with happiness. Life is good. God is good. Like you couldn't get a complaint out of me today if you tried.@yanelizable And many more to go.‚úå@yanelizable Na..we've been best friends longer than that..@DatKiddAngel @yanelizable I'M DYING üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇThrowing shade at @MeredithKnightt before he ever met her. https://t.co/vekuNxpvV4@NoelSmithh https://t.co/4T92IEG3nPI'm about sick and tired of people not being able to carry on a conversation with me unless they need/want something.@yanelizable I love best creek.Bad parenting is the downfall of civilization.@yanelizable  https://t.co/WT5HZzuV6V@yanelizable I'll fight you. Football is better. There I win.@L_Belcher24 Yea but strictly visitation for gracie. But don't speak to him. That's bad.Annalise Keating is my fictional role model. Also, Viola Davis is my favorite actress. Perfect 2 for 1 deal.@L_Belcher24 I mean maybe you could go by sometime for visitation...@L_Belcher24 You never even told me you were dating someone so I personally didn't approve of the relationship to begin with.@pres_holland After 21 years I feel like I have a pretty good picture of who you are.@pres_holland Actually no I haven't...I actually went to school for the primary reason to learn..I guess you went for all those secondary reasons.@pres_holland Also it's pathetic how many times I've heard that same critism from you. It's almost as if you constantly find the need to make others look small so that you feel big. It must be hard being so insecure.@pres_holland Here we go again. Haven't heard that one 72 times. If I'm never a lawyer it's because I decide not to be..my circumstances have made it possible to get there if I want to and I can see that.@pres_holland Alright buddy. But we both know what you've said behind closed doors.. üòâ@_queenNSB Girl you know I never forget..@pres_holland No one said anything about participation trophies or this fictitious t-ball game going on in your head. I honestly don't know why I'm conversing with someone who I personally know is racist, sexist, and goes on twitter just to find people to argue with. It's not cute..It's sad.@_queenNSB *cough* Trent in 7th grade. *cough*@pres_holland I'm not a liberal. I'm just a realist and can see how the world works beyond my own circumstances. Obviously you can't.@pres_holland I didn't say that the hand your dealt determines your life...I said it has a large impact. You should really read more closely. Also if you don't see that some people have more opportunities than others then your blinded by your own privilege.@Jake_Tipton57 Which is understandable that you became offended..but just try looking at it from another perspective.@Jake_Tipton57 It's easy to say that we all make our own choices and that is what our life is made of...but the cards you're  dealt do have a large impact on your life. I suggest looking into the book "Rigging the Game" by Michael Schwalbe. Try putting yourself in another race's/class's shoes.I wish I never met you.I wish I could go back in time and tell myself "look away...yes he's charming now, but one day he'll just be fat and rude."@L_Belcher24 Rude. I thought I was your hunny bunny.The only bad thing about Tuscaloosa is that my dog isn't here..@BStepbackk I needed that.@L_Belcher24 Liar.@L_Belcher24 You make terrible decisions.Guy behind me yelling at the ref:
