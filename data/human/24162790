Opportunistic, but naughty! :) #TTOT@thesafaririch @GlobalGrapevine @ankit1989 Like I said, it depends where you're travelling, and who with. Heathrow? No way. But in many airports around the world, there is no CCTV, and staff aren't searched. And more often than not, they are searched by airport security...who are usually the culprits! #ttot@SocialMediaLond A2. The ability to see beyond a brand logo. People interact with people. People trust people more than brands. If brands humanise themselves, and be transparent, that goes a long way to building authenticity. #smlondon@ankit1989 @thesafaririch A4. Sometimes, yes. Depends where I'm travelling, and the airline I'm travelling with. But, in all honesty, if someone wants to get into your bag, no lock will stop them 🙃 #ttot@SocialMediaLond A1.
