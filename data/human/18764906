@maureenjohnson This is NO GOOD for my manuscript revisions, MJ.@maureenjohnson Can I be the SPINNING Maid of SPINNING?Today is Arsène Wenger’s last home match as the manager of Arsenal Football Club. What a legend. #MerciArsène@BrianWFoster @TheVulcanSalute I miss those dessert pizzasAnd, yes, I do prefer the cover John Mayer did, but still. No need to ruin either version.Also, if you’re the sort of person who needs to put a dance beat under Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’”— consider being a different person.I just heard a commercial marketing a car called a Mirage and they used the phrases “seeing is believing” and “where the deals are real” and I’m pretty sure none of the irony was intentional.May the Fourth be with you all! @HamillHimself@_mauleon @BeQuietAndrew Oh noooooooo@BeQuietAndrew  https://t.co/X1mQPwP46rExcept for 6ix9ine and Bhad Bhabie. They know what they did.@ronnykhuri Saving Huttese for later?Someone on reddit is reviewing all 126 XXL Freshmen Candidates, so why not check ‘em all out?Van Lathan was ready to go with that rebuttal of everything Kanye’s been doing &amp; saying these past weeks! Is Ye doing it for the attention? No doubt. But the fact that folks like Van and John Legend aren’t afraid to say “hang on a second” to Ye with respect is awesome to meWe also found a creepy porcelain doll head half-buried in the dirt. My Paladin is the one with the Bag of Holding, and you better believe that I’m not letting that go in the bag.We then encountered a skeleton on a bone horse, who our Fighter attacked immediately. The skeleton horse did more damage to the Fighter than the werewolf did.Our DM, bless him, rolled terribly, and the Fighter basically beat the tar out of the werewolf. The rest of the werewolves, intimidated by his ability, leave with their tails between their legs. #curseofstrahd #DnDTonight in Curse of Strahd: Our Shou Human Fighter is dueling the leader of the Werewolves, surrounded by the battle cry of wolves and ravens and the flicker of torches.@BeQuietAndrew You’re totally right, but in my campaign elves mostly use stories and a strong oral tradition for history and use magic for communication over distance(most elves early on lived in large communities and didn’t engage the outside world.)FYI:
1: Dwarves have the first written language (Darvek), but the writing system was perfected by Gnomes (Gnomin Glyphed).
2: Elves don’t cultivate plants for paper, but do use what materials are naturally available.
3: I don’t really know why other languages do it, so no. #DnDSometimes planning for your next #DnD session is easy, but sometimes your brain keeps distracting you with questions like “Which race of creature came up with writing first?” &amp; “Would elves be cool with killing trees to make paper?” &amp; “Would any languages use gender for objects?”@thatlauraruby @lainitaylor After the shooting in CA where a guy shot up like a sorority bc “he wasn’t getting the female attention he wanted”, I stupidly thought more guys would stand against that, not take inspiration from it. That was my own privilege at work. That toxic masculinity needs to be stopped.@thatlauraruby Whole-heartedly agree.@anneursu I know you’re being facetious, but the last thing we need is a way for Brita to duck praise. She’s a damn expert at this point!Just finished my reread of White Cat by Holly Black. Holy damn. That book really holds up! I enjoyed it even more than the last time I read it.There’s only one Arsène Wenger. Sad to see the legend go. What an icon, what a pioneer for the beautiful game! You will be missed, Professor. #MerciArsène@mightymudha There’s a separate one for Ocean Bonfire too!There is also an option for Snoring Shih Tzu. That seems oddly specific? Like, was there not a demand for Slobbering Saint Bernard or Wheezing Westie or are the rights too expensive for other dog breeds?For the record, I am a fan of rain.I have one of those sound apps to help with the sleeping, and amidst the many soothing rain and nature sounds one can choose there is one for a crackling fire. That can’t be right, can it? The sound of logs burning can’t be reassuring when one is trying to sleep, can it?@lilywritesstuff @britasandstrom You guys joined when we were going into 3rd, which means you heard it at the Student Reading at the hotel, if I recall correctly.IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!!!! https://t.co/NXXccaQQ7wTickled to be the 7,816th 🐲 on @BackerKit for Strongholds &amp; Streaming. Thanks @mattcolville https://t.co/8rGrrVgD9L@britasandstrom I 100% forgot about that.@britasandstrom And the Mummy, apparently. Which is, unsurprisingly, the one I was referring to.@britasandstrom Nothing about this surprises me and I haven’t seen three of the four.My #FilmStruck4  shouldn't surprise anyone, tbf.
I'm tagging @maraudingstevie, @TheJosh_H,  @britasandstrom and @anneursu, what four films define you? https://t.co/H5LpxUfBkJ@thatlauraruby it is your birthday! Happy birthday! May you be swarmed with many affectionate cats who will definitely not knock your drink off the end table😺I don’t have any recent pictures of just me and my sibs, my dang parents and wife keep on adding… https://t.co/RktUNNUNqP@ChynaGrove For the record, I spent like $75 extra on a bass that had a totally pointless visual thing that I liked better than the “regular” model.@ChynaGrove My vote is get the one you want, unless saving that $$$ is more attractiveThe best thing about being sick-ish is that my tastebuds are totally freaked out and hate everything.Sometimes I say stuff and my teenage self shakes his head at me in disbelief and disdain. Today it was: “Wow, those lightbulbs we put in the bathroom are no joke.”@hankgreen @valerie2776 Maybe you and John’s faces should?Lightning game! #gobolts https://t.co/gA6XtgsuuI@johngreen Good concept, wrong video.When my wife sees me dancing in her peripheral vision: “What happened? Did you almost fall over?!” #badatdancing@TheJosh_H @BeQuietAndrew From what I’ve heard, it’s stupid fun. I’m not much of a PvP guy, so I’m waiting on it for now.@BeQuietAndrew That’s a good note, thanks!This is super important. https://t.co/B68njnKYor@kellybarnhill Holy crap. “Oh yeah, I forgot about him stabbing his wife. That’s not really worth remembering, you know?”@BeQuietAndrew That frikken pickle. What a pain in the rearBOOM. Monster Hunter: World DEFEATED!@anneursu @jhillmanbooks @thatlauraruby Oh jeez, I wouldn’t even have gotten that far. That whole spiders thing?! Fuck that noise.@anneursu @jhillmanbooks @thatlauraruby Lol now you know why I’m not in G-Unit either. Brains before bravery!@jhillmanbooks @anneursu @thatlauraruby Weirdly, my TimeHop reminded me today of a twitter convo 3 years ago about Anne and Laura’s Houses! Laura was a Ravenclaw but I think Anne was trying to convince her to join Gryffindor.@hankgreen You missed a spot when blurring his name!My grandfather, the cat lover.https://t.co/Sn3l2b3PQ9Black Panther time!@mightymudha That doesn't sound like a glowing recommendation, right?This bass-ackward state, man. https://t.co/ggMv9kQCkA3 things I need to start writing: (1) headphones brimming with music (2) a drink or two (3) a stretch of time with no one laying in it. Tagging @maraudingstevie @britasandstrom @jennife730 https://t.co/S2xYyQsvPN@theohhellos How about the "I Keep Forgetting The Ceiling Fan Is There So I Hit My Hand On A Fan Blade And My Head On The Light Fixture." 
That's a family classic! 
And my wife and I will be at your Orlando show as an anniversary present to ourselves!@TheJosh_H @ronnykhuri Same!You have 100% lost my vote and I will tell every person I know to vote you out of office unless you do SOMETHING to address gun violence. Your constituents are watching, do the right thing!@KathleenMPeters You are my Representative and I'm galled to see you voted against the assault weapons ban while survivors of the #StonemanDouglas shooting looked on. You ignored them and instead listened to an organization that profits off tragedies like this one. #NeverAgain
