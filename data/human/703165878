“Be consistently quotable on social media, or else STFU. Cuz there’s enough noise.” ~ a friend #ToughLoveChristians who argue with nonbelievers for the purpose of scoring points in a debate lack the spirit of the Christ they claim to be defending.Being a decent human being is FAR more important than being talented. Sad this needs to be said.James L Brooks has produced some great movies: the age of seventeen, Spanglish, how do you know... that’s my kind of material.@roseperson Well, given how hard you clearly work, not only on your language, but on your content, I presumed you'd want to know that we get it. ❤️@roseperson 🙏🏾@roseperson, your tweets are consistently 💯. People like you are the reason why I'm even on here. I really appreciate your words.@ericasipes OK. I'm buying it. ❤️🎵🎹This is a serious Red-Pill thread, worthy of hard copy. https://t.co/jlsqodlaHp@ericasipes I think I asked you this a few years ago but never followed up on it: do you have piano-related products that I can buy?@ericasipes Wow! I've considered the fact that if I became visually impaired, I'd have no choice but to go cold-turkey, and I would, and it would work.@ericasipes This thing about not moving my head if I look down is probably going to be big. I can feel it.@ericasipes Thank you so much for all the information you've shared over the years, Erica. Your free stuff is better than some people pay for.@ericasipes I'm sure it will. And it's OK if you don't know about that, because I definitely do. 🎹🎯I'm a play-by-ear guy, so I totally agree with this. It's almost as if music is about sound. (The academy emphasizes reading and technique.) https://t.co/a2KzYb1e7y@ericasipes Well you're one of the best piano teachers in the world, so I trust anything you say. And I'm at the need-to-trust stage right now.@ericasipes If it turns out that's a very good analogy, then I just got lucky. 🙂If only church felt and sounded like this all the time... Wow. 🎵❤️🎹🎤🥁🎸⛪️🏥 https://t.co/lI7aDSDG5M@vocal_kim Wow. Sounds like a less pretentious version of Ashley Madison.🤣🤣🤣😫😫😫😭😭😭 ALL the damn emojis! https://t.co/Vjr2FMuG8TMe too! I never would have dreamed that behavior can be biologically determined. My choices feel independent. Some are probably not. https://t.co/onxWNHBjL6@vocal_kim Hi Kim. Have you seen Monica Lewinsky's TED talk? I found it very enlightening.@ericasipes I've heard: "The best way to learn anything is to do it." Hence, the best way to learn how to play w/o looking is to play w/o looking. Yes?@ericasipes Given my level of technical development, I should probably do a combination of both. Learn repertoire by looking, play exercises blind.I've found that students not being able to play the kind of music that they really like (other than classical) is a big factor. https://t.co/BLQvpSIvg4@mrpianoensemble @ericasipes Excellent point re: developmental level.

My lips are sealed.@ericasipes I have some no-look exercises from Faith Madwell, but it seems more direct to just go right to the repertoire.@ericasipes OK thanks I will. Now that I have assurance from a professional teacher that it's OK to make a lot of mistakes.@ericasipes I was wondering if I should keep reading it over &amp; over blind until I no longer make mistakes. I make a lot of mistakes when I don't look.@ericasipes Oh wow that's actually enlightening. I didn't realize it was possible to look peripherally.When practicing piano sight-reading, should you keep your eyes on the music &amp; don't look down, even if you're making mistakes, @ericasipes?No more basing important life decisions on unfounded assumptions.https://t.co/Xt7oliBT2LTrue artists really are ahead of the Curve. That's not a cliché.When authors like @jesmimi commit to whatever Truth claims them (and they are prisoners), it seems that Time eventually endorses them. https://t.co/ZeXvMTZeBFThere are people, in the 21st century, who really believe that something isn't real because they never saw it happen. https://t.co/iETCQmTNRKOoooooh oh oh oh this makes me so very happy. @jesmimi and @viet_t_nguyen are thinkers' essentials. https://t.co/shosFTjooFI stopped saying "I'm done giving a fk" when I realized I never gave one to begin with.This Weinstein thing really shows how much people value money &amp; fame over dignity. (And also, to be fair, not being called liars.)Aaaaand there they go doing that thing again.
