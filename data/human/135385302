As it is I will never buy another World garment. https://t.co/op1kcfbt4N@adzebill By extension, the "made in NZ" label inside my World skirt might also just refer to the label, right?@tonywalljourno Apparently so.

Aren't the photos amazing - when you consider they were working with film, presumably in low light, and in dreadful weather@FitKiwi @SaturdayRNZ Yeah that's what makes it thorny - the idea more men die with it than from it, so you risk invasive and potentially harmful intervention for something that would never have caused problems.@OliverLewis @NZStuff Thanks OliverReally useful and informative discussion about prostate cancer testing on @SaturdayRNZ thanks@macbet @NZStuff Thanks Brian - now there's a depressing thought!

Brian wasn't the only one who floated a baby to safety. From memory a crewman who couldn't swim did the same. So many acts of heroism, small and large.@dairymanNZ So sorry to hear that.

Those files sat on a table in the newsroom for months. I remember leafing through them having a good laugh.@tonywalljourno Congrats! (although, like Charlie, I thought you already were in everything but name)And the bus that eventually turned up has busted call buttons. Wave out if you want to get off, the driver says. I feel bad for the driversSuits on scooters. Just no@malosilima I’m pretty sure this guy must be the cause of my bus troubles https://t.co/0fgRKq1796Oh look the number 4 bus seems to have vapourised somewhere between “due” and my bus stop. What a surprise. Shame @metlinkwgtn seems incapable of sticking to its own schedulehttps://t.co/770UgWelMl https://t.co/ZEbVeYoAVXMy bus has to stand idle for five minutes because the motor has overheated. Due to overcrowding, the driver says. There were about three people standing.

Maybe I will start running in to work, instead of home@metlinkwgtn Thanks for the response but in future you might want to prioritise services where people have no other options, rather than just leaving us standing in the pouring rain. This has happened to me several times and I don't even usually take the bus in the morning.@malosilima One driver told me there was a bus shortage. If they don't have enough buses (or drivers) to run existing routes I'm not sure how they're going to run an expanded networkI live 10 minutes drive from central Wellington. It has taken me an hour and 15 minutes to get here. I can run the distance in 40 minutes. If we want people to use public transport it needs to be reliable. @greaterwgtn @metlinkwgtn@kjrothwell How is yours going?So now I am cold, soaked to my underwear and late for work. Go public transportSo we all stand in the rain waiting for the last bus from Owhiro Bay, which never turns up, with no warning or explanation. Nice one @metlinkwgtn. Thanks to the helpful school bus driver who took all the stranded people to Island Bay.@MattNippert I've been on page 333 of The Pale King for about three years. I finally moved it from the bedside (after partner protestations) but can't quite bring myself to admit defeat. It's about a tax examiner - you'd love it!@IMandley And there I was thinking they were just reading it for free online.@comingupcharlie Also - best intro in agesApparently journalists are insecure and the media revenue model is broken. Here's a crazy thought - maybe these two things are related.
https://t.co/aOfJLILb2JWondering what all this Cambridge Analytica stuff is about? Here's a feature I wrote a while back about the Facebook personality profiling tool it's based on: What does your Facebook profile say about you? https://t.co/aWw0lKoLpXThread. #FixtheOIA https://t.co/3ZFxDkphs0Why is anyone talking about the Russell McVeagh sexual harassment scandal and why is the legal profession being forced to think seriously about this issue? Oh - that's right, because a journalist -
not the police - brought it into the public eye. https://t.co/BcKEsWNQua@tonywalljourno But also - we should absolutely be randomly investigating other law firms. Why wouldn't you ring around and try to establish if this is a problem that is widespread? When the Harvey Weinstein allegations surfaced, journos found other cases by asking everyone the same questionsAndrew Geddis on closed court passport case: "It’s just a good thing we live in a country where we can be sure the government gets things right, the security agencies never overreact to perceived threats and the courts always follow proper procedures."  https://t.co/AhKBtQXd9A@traceyrcooper @tonywalljourno I know - so hard to fathom, right...We're fine. Oh - look over there@tonywalljourno It's not journos I'm talking about - it's the profession and the unis who are making this all about Russell McVeagh@chrisinchch @GraemeEdgeler Interesting. It would be great if they would stand up and acknowledge those former issues, and talk about how they cleaned it up.Aren't people missing the point here? Does anyone really believe Russell McVeagh is any different from any other big law firm? Seems more likely they're just the fall guy for a much wider problem, which probably extends beyond law firms. https://t.co/5cgd4qFAM7@thekitchenmaid @thebrittmann Yeah I totally related to the pre-pot luck angst!@thekitchenmaid those eggplant and feta nibbles are one of my bring-a-plate go-tos. So fantastic for minimal effort. But can you stop broadcasting the recipe. It was bad enough when my aunt and I both made them@michelle_duff Um, yes. I feel like we all need to OIA the paper trail behind all the media responses we've ever received. Except most of it probably goes on off email.@kirsty_johnston It actually came to me via someone else, who had OIA'd related stuff. So from that point of view the OIA did work!And this is what was actually sent to me by Justice Ministry PR boss Antony Paltridge. The tribunal chairman is supposed to be an independent judicial officer. So who changed his response, and on what grounds? #ThereIsNoTransparency #FixTheOIA https://t.co/jcAtiJFDAR1/2 Last year I asked about delays at the Human Rights Review Tribunal. This is the very comprehensive answer the tribunal chairman - the person who actually knows about this - drafted in response to my query. https://t.co/ylHzmiek9I‘Access to justice is being denied to almost all': Human Rights Review Tribunal chairman Rodger Haines.

It does not appear to be in any way relevant to the crash.
