Gutted I finished it now!Finished up Sneaky Pete season 2. Very enjoyable tv show.@jimmyjimmy134 Had worse bets to be fair.Second, no good to me but wouldn’t have backed the winner.Just in town getting some clothes that fit. Popped into the bookies stuck a bullseye on Laurens in the 1000 Guineas.@seeley_nigel 🤣 Noted for next time! Ha.But hey, ain’t all bad. Always someone worse off and better off than you. Just gotta keep moving forward however pointless that feels sometimes.I remember when made 5 figures in a month after tax, Then spent every single penny on a woman, just imagine being that stupid 🙋🏼‍♂️@Melanha See my next tweet. Need to clear a debt first too.As harsh as it sounds I’ll never get myself into debt again helping someone out with mental illness issues. 5 years later still paying it off whilst she’s long gone and doesn’t give a fuck. No more Mr Nice Will.Same as every weekend, bored shitless by 10am. Need to get to where I wanna be in the gym then fuck off round the world.@Clarks76 Ah mate tell me about it.

I’ve been back 6 months now.@zeeuw Fingers crossed for you guys then! Looking forward to the World Cup now!@zeeuw Luckily a lot of teams below us very under par.

Going to finish it up over the weekend. Shame its only 10 episodes.@MartinSLewis I'm happy with just the water.@spurslee82 I’m half way through, it’s enjoyable. Could easily binge them all!@spurslee82 Have you finished Sneaky Pete s2 yet?@MrDuggy 🤣 I need to book my 11th visit soon! I highly recommend Grey Area but you’re probably aware of it.@MrDuggy You been before? Trying any of the delights?@YorksherGrump Think I can say goodbye to that money! hahaMy boss doing the Panini sticker album, said I’ll back the first team completed.. already regretting it. https://t.co/Xd3hR2DCDoLol@brownmc Nah fuck that you keep em!@brownmc Got a book going at work. I’m putting £20 on the first team completed... so far Brazil, Iran and Japan with one left! Ideally don’t wanna back the others 🤣@brownmc Damn. No worries.@brownmc Have you got Coutinho as a swap?@bozi1988 @SkySports Don't blame you, I paid £50 for a year of IPTV service get everything on Sky and more all in perfect HD! Plus 3pm kick offs.@bozi1988 @SkySports Come on, you know it'll be going up!@Liamgeraghty_ Yeah, every club that finishes below us should liquidate, 7 straight losses with no goals, pretty special turnaround.@Liamgeraghty_ Palace mate.@Liamgeraghty_ Fuck em, shame they aint going back down!@Liamgeraghty_ United, City and Liverpool and only United at home... no chance! Might nick a point at most.@MattDVale Not having it! Its defo not London! I'm with you on the outside M25 theory!@MattDVale That aint London, Hertfordshire isn't it!?@Liamgeraghty_ Still could go either way this! Think my £5 is safe though!I hope David Haye gets his face caved in on Saturday.Lol what a time to drop a clanger.@bellavance_r Bloody nutters the lot of em!Logs in to #CPFC BBS, see's the top thread.. logs straight off. https://t.co/CWYapqK04l@Smith_Vee Yeah I’m up for that, just let me know when is good for you. I think I’ve still got your number I’ll drop you a text now.@Smith_Vee Dunno might do, gym taking over my life at the moment just cracking on with that and hoping someone comes along when I don’t look for it. Some female company would be nice  though@Smith_Vee Haha, yeah they don’t give me grief!@Smith_Vee Oh well you never know! Closest I can get to a date at the moment is a dumbbell or a treadmill 🤣@Smith_Vee Thought I had replied to this and you didn't respond but looks like I didn't even reply 🤣Where did you go? Will you see him again?@ANTGILES Very true, I ended up back in the gym in the end! Rarely hit the pub anyway never really been my thing.West Ham 🤣🤣It’s all starting to take shape. https://t.co/5QNW9L85sv@SketchpadTheGr8 Stealing my look 🤣@SketchpadTheGr8 More like a thumb I though.@lutontown007 I only do what I feel I can do. Can eat more if I do more too https://t.co/GQ16gI5FhUDry pitch again ffs 🤣🤣 https://t.co/t9FUxiPqyV8 miles of walking and 90 mins in the gym on the weights done before 9:30. Bored now.. prob end up back in the gym after lunch.@SketchpadTheGr8 I’m on! Fingers crossed. Cute profile pic btw.@SketchpadTheGr8 There’s a horse called Feebs (wrong spelling but close enough) running today that has a very good chance  3:15 Wetherby.Watching the highlights back and Leicester even worse than I thought when watching live. That Maguire geezer is the biggest mong I’ve ever seen. We need to sign Loftus-Cheek and Zaha is the greatest player in the land, but we all knew that anyway.BENTEKEEEEEERolls Royce that boy. Up the fucking Palace.Zaha too good.He’s fucking magicShould Bournemouth be 4/1? Are Southampton no longer dogshit?Cmon PalaceMade me laugh https://t.co/xeuVDZtYUI@garryt123 Palace win today to top it off would be nice!@garryt123 35kgs. Might need a little more though but I have been mostly strength training as have built a better frame already just my gut being stubborn!!@Snowy_Owl55 Feel good. Still 9kgs til I hit target but  I may have to add another 5lg to that but we’ll see in around 9 weeks.@lutontown007 💪🏻Week 22 - Kilo wiped out. 26kg total loss a pound off 4 stone.@G00nerboy Fuck off!!!@G00nerboy Need to win this! New Blacklist up for after the game.@NufcNiallers Loving it so far.@sambrookjames Haha!@sambrookjames Too late!@G00nerboy Yeah if I want a new tv.@Ussi_has True but I actually needed them!@Ussi_has Waiting for the next new one I think, no point getting the X now it’s nearly 9 months old! AirPods are an awesome product glad I got them. Watch pretty sexy too!Somebody stop me https://t.co/yMlRw3KofJ@Snowy_Owl55 Can get pricey but over 200/1 double yesterday.. once you hit one you’ve got a pot for a while.@Snowy_Owl55 Put em both in.This Madrid keeper is a nutter.@MICK2058 👍🏻@Ash_Bradders Enjoy.@Ash_Bradders Quite a few yes. Madison is quite nice, overlooks St Pauls Cathedral. Decent views from The Aviary in Finsbury Square too.SDS as the double with two 14/1 winners both him and Crowley go to Lingfield for 1 ride each. Could be a nice evening.@ANTGILES Missed that Crowley 50/1 the other day :(@ponyboy987 Yes it can get a bit crazy at times but honestly cant remember drawing many blanks.. and the winners out weighed the losers. They both had trebles on one day I remember which paid handsomely.@ponyboy987 For example today https://t.co/gxVzVXthhh@ponyboy987 No, I would do doubles and trebles on them both as one bet wherever they both are. The singles are usually on the ones I think are the most likely winners.@ponyboy987 Like today I covered them back 1 of Crowley and one of SDS but not the 14/1 winner SDS has had! Typically.@ponyboy987 My theory was as simple as it sounds cover them all and generally get atleast a treble a day. Backed EW when they at same meeting and same races. Singles would be on ones I fancied to win.. sometimes went arseways on singles ie backing a 4/1 and Crowley getting home on a 40/1@ponyboy987 Haha! Was great when they were both head to head for the title you always got a run for your money.@ponyboy987 I don't have my stats to hand, but for various seasons I have backed all their rides together in doubles and trebles and made profit, sometimes larger than others.@ponyboy987 De Sousa mate.@OstlundWept @Ashley_SCFC @fakekanekushner @danstephenson12 @Conor7Mullin @JKevinAnthony6 @ClinicalSilva @x29GXi @HectorBellerin Wan-Bissaka isn't on Twitter lads.@chrisbenteke Hat-Trick on Saturday Christian.@Ewaydouble Lol, that would be some skill.@Ewaydouble Yeah he is also on my radar..Think its about time to start covering the SDS and Crowley multiples. In 4 years or so I've made money every season just doing this pretty much blind.@Snowy_Owl55 Yeah its like a whole fancy spa that's attached to my gym, they do loads of different things and I could have used the facilities after the massage but left in time to catch the game last night. Will have to try it all out next time.@Snowy_Owl55 Was very good, still feel a bit of tension there today but it feels 100 times better than it did. Think I need to make it a fortnightly thing!LolHow did this lot beat Barcelona, football eh.Lol lol lol laters pasta boys.Henderson lifting the Champions League trophy just imagine that, Sickening.. Done well tonight mind.These lot are going to win the cup and deservedly so.Take a bow.Some lovely football from Liverpool. Mane needs binning though.He’s some boy. #SalahIncredible.@GymAppelle I’d passout without carbs. It’s literally basic maths if you wanna lose weight no need for fancy diets or points systems.@GymAppelle Exactly that, been putting more effort in on the weights now and eating much more than when I started.@brownmc I don't think its anything serious, just a ache from training. I seriously batter my back and chest when I work those muscles as I was told that was good?! No idea if true or not but both have muscles I never knew existed before.@ANTGILES Never in my life! Even been to Amsterdam 10 times and not tried out the delights that you couldn't smoke.@brownmc Couldn't care less even if it was a gorilla doing it as long as it helps me out, I've not stopped aching since day 1.@Snowy_Owl55 Only £35 for 25 mins. Seems pretty reasonable.I have a Swedish Back, Neck and Shoulder massage tonight booked in for after the gym. Back has been in bits since I been hitting the weights, hopefully this helps me out. Never had a massage in my life.@YorksherGrump It goes down well, high protein as you can probably tell and keeps me going until I finish up in the gym around 7:30pm. Breakfast is always a bigun too then dinner usualy the smallest of the 3 meals for me.@YorksherGrump Topside beef in a bit of spice mix.@SketchpadTheGr8 And no stalker/weirdo! Win win!@SketchpadTheGr8 Yeah I feel much better for it, not had anything classed a junk food (inc snacks, crisps etc) and only drunk water since 22nd November. Pretty simple in theory. Are you still enjoying your job?@SketchpadTheGr8 Thanks! 25kgs now still 10 to go but I think I'll need a little more to be happy but we'll see what I think in 10 weeks. Bit of gut still hanging around.@SketchpadTheGr8 lol, I'm amazed im still sticking to this lifestyle change of mine, pretty much a new man now.@SketchpadTheGr8 Get some grub in ya! Had a 600 cal breakfast too. Still a bit peckish but I have already done 14000 steps today and not even been to the gym yet!768 cals in my lunch nowadays, eating more and still losing a KG a week 🐷 https://t.co/k3niHvcDaV@brownmc No, it’s on the list for now. Might even do 2 places.@brownmc No a fan of France. Lil sisters fella is Romanian and I’ve worked with a few, they always say how nice certain parts are. Valencia should be good.@brownmc I’ve heard good things about places in Romania.@brownmc Sad but I literally have one mate. He’s married with a kid and has 3 holidays already booked this year!@ckrac1ng Good shout.@DaveSymmonds On the list it goes.@jimmyjimmy134 I know haha.@jimmyjimmy134 Fuck you! Not my fault I got dumped after ten years for some lame arse reasons!@DaveSymmonds Is this a serious suggestion? Is that where all the kids go to get smashed on a fiver then shit their pants?@_robracing666 Have always wanted to go there actually.@aob7982 Anywhere in particular you recommend or can you get to all areas pretty easily? Looks like quite a small island.@DaRidiclus1 Ok, you've convinced me and its in the mix!@lutontown007 Wouldn't be interested nthe golf. Plus the French get on my nerves, went to Paris once and didn't really enjoy it that much. Tbf I had a whinging woman with me so that probably tainted the experience!@DaRidiclus1 No.. I just picture it as a party island which is probably the wrong perception but just not sure about it.@lutontown007 Dubai is on the list but quite pricey, plus was always meant to do it with the ex so might leave that one a bit longer. I wanna go for the racing might do that next March.@DaRidiclus1 Not feeling Ibiza for some reason.@NIR30 Yeah I cant imagine I'll be bored on my own there tbh. Either way I will get there very soon.Algarve seems pretty popular.. keep em coming people. I'm not very well travelled only been to Oman, Spain, Holland x10, Paris and Cyprus. Oh and Switzerland but I wouldn't go back there again.@NIR30 I think that would be much better with a group rather than on my own but if it doesn't go ahead that will be at the top of my list, the ex was meant to take me there on my 30th still waiting 2 years later! haha@NIR30 That's on my list but might be doing that with a bloke from work for his 40th with a group of his mates so holding fire until that's a goer or not.I'm planning on booking myself a holiday for later in the year as a reward/incentive for my weight loss.. probably looking at end of July/August time, want somewhere hot, with decent stuff to do as I'll be on my todd. If anyone has any recommendations please let me know.@aaronfrancis93 Pretty petty though, although I get your point.The state of Klopp when his team don’t win 🤣 they didn’t water the pitch 🤣🤣 what a bellend.Gotta love the English football officiating. Watford clearly set out to kick Zaha all over the park and he gets a yellow for it. #HesJustTooGoodForYouSomeone give Roy a nudge the old bastard is forgetting we can use subs again.I’ve seen Palace play bad many times but this is something else.Joel Ward fucking it right up. Player of the month on the bench.Cmon Palace. https://t.co/xWYArTVmhuRoma shitting themselves 🤣Wan-Bissaka on the bench 😩Whole of Watford basically at a stand still. Player coach not even arrived.Week 21 - 1kg lost. 25kg total https://t.co/ZTqwlhV2cB@ANTGILES Its still there mate 😍Gym, food, on the road to Watford.@D_3_L_B_O_Y I’ve not been cutting carbs at all. Need them for the gym work I do. Gotta whatever suits you in the end, cutting all the crap works for me. I enjoy everything I eat now which helps.
