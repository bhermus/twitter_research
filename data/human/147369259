IndyCar and now IMSA@AlexD77_ @FOXSports That's the biggest thing that sucks about FOX, if it's not NASCAR they seem to not care much about the average fan@AlexD77_ I'm happy about this too... @FOXSports loves showing most of theit events on FS2 where probably most don't get or wanna pay for the package for itAnd here's the other https://t.co/d2XSk6zZg8This must be what @Twitter locked me out about.

As to where some can't üëçI can't complain at least @KyleBusch has a car the team can roll back up on the hauler all in one piece #NASCARDamage assessment on the 18..... 4 tires #NASCAR48 almost looked like he blew a tire #NASCAR.@KyleBusch was involved in that one.. doesn't look all that bad.. seems to be very little damage #NASCAR@Addisababy @Rickveerman1 @Max33Verstappen @Dan_Rigsby I couldn't agree with you more... Being aggressive is one thing... He's over aggressive@BiancaHinderks It's all the truth.Keso almost squirreled um up #NASCAR@BiancaHinderks and BTW the tweet of mine you responded too... Had zip to do with Vettel or any other driver!!! It was Max@BiancaHinderks and who are you?? Really.. another Max fan girl.. daddy will keep him in the car just like how he probably got Kvyat out so his son could get in@DavidfromMD @ToyotaRacing ROFLMAO@2TeamPenske22 ROFLMAO, that's next üòÇüòÇNow...

Constantly blocking on a straight... Give the fella one side or the other.@F1Noob @Rickveerman1 @Max33Verstappen @Dan_Rigsby Let's hope this gets sorted out... You know Horner doesn't play aroundThis ain't all that bad... Cars spread out some... Not one massive pack #NASCARShithouse... Got kicked out of line #NASCARMy bad.. Kurt got his spot #NASCAR@DavidfromMD Max would fit in perfect...  Along with Maldonado and Grosjean 1.0It's time to hold your breath and hope your driver isn't involved in the crash #NASCAR so exciting!!!!@SkySportsF1 In other words..  you sort your driver's out RBR@Rickveerman1 @Max33Verstappen @Dan_Rigsby Been in the sport long enough to know better@Rickveerman1 @Max33Verstappen @Dan_Rigsby At this rate. Max will crash himself out of F1.@Rickveerman1 @Max33Verstappen @Dan_Rigsby What? Everyone Max is involved in.... That's rubbish.. how many times does a fella need to throw a block on a long straight https://t.co/k5oaouBr78@Max33Verstappen @Dan_Rigsby You're the common denominator in it all...
