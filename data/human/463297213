Also made goulash in it recently.@JaredSandler And our love for IKF grows.

Teach Rougie how to play LF.They did https://t.co/Rcj180NxTFBut but but......Rougie is the one with the $50 mil contract. https://t.co/l3TwYujGps@JaredSandler He’s got a 120 in him somewhere@tboone68 @JaredSandler 1. We don’t have any other options they feel can do as well 
2. With Perez still out they can’t really remove him 
3. The FO here doesn’t readily admit mistakes or give up on guys- see Drew Robinson
4. They aren’t trading for Harvey
5. He’s only SP we have until Timmy is ready@tboone68 @JaredSandler It won’t be.Smh... https://t.co/OxTjNnKx7WYup https://t.co/bz8uUVUKsT@Doc_Texas Let’s talk about this in 3 years...I wish I knew a Spanish-speaking Mexican (because plenty don’t speak it) who could help me learn Spanish. I’d love to learn. https://t.co/xJjECj7AVX@LongHornFrenzy This can’t be true. Aggy said Brewster had him in the bag. https://t.co/f3WGrb5oeb@BottomOfDeOrder It’s sad that it’s better to be a Tiger without Verlandrer and Kinsler than it is to be a Texas Ranger right now.

I’m #RideOrDie but they’re killing me.Matt Moore needs to be DFA’d. I don’t know why this is even debateable.Half of the team retiring from baseball, apparently. https://t.co/ZG2II7LddHHAHA...never fails Texas takes a guy who is bad and gives them a phantom injury. https://t.co/W3pziHNozA@ControlFreq1 @DLoesch @shannonrwatts The SS only forbad guns during POTUS/VP speeches.I’m so glad you think this. More for me. https://t.co/yxofVLiFa0@DLoesch I can’t take people seriously who make up lies to get attention and create division.@lonestarball I’d personally love him moved back to 1B asap.@chrisochoa3030 @therealbaber I’ve never had a lease.@DLoesch Exactly.@chrisochoa3030 @therealbaber I’d love to hunt but $7k? Way too rich for me.Maybe next year https://t.co/YDjHZRPAya@chrisochoa3030 @therealbaber Plus.....chicken fried deer steak is amazing@therealbaber “automatic” weaponsI’m pretty sure nobody went to any gathering with automatic weapons. https://t.co/51GNfAxWcp@robert_castaldi @BDavisAAS @bevobeat Watson and Ingram aren’t averageARGHHHH

If you don’t want to live then do whatever you need....STOP KILLING OTHER PEOPLE FIRST!! https://t.co/KtPORtBbCg@lonestarball Somebody actually said that?????@MBHORNSFAN @thelonghorns12 Lol. I already am trying to get some people to chill about A&amp;M. It’s May. Herman has proven he can recruit and the Aggies 2018 schedule with their current team is gonna be a killer.

But hey...it ain’t Texas if they sky ain’t falling right?@thelonghorns12 They need to chill.@tre1watson Gonna wreck some teams this year.YEAH BABY https://t.co/NYqMW6omDY@ReedRobertson @Englandsr01 @TheDozens1 @jeff_kaye @pitnews I asked you for specific Bible verses already and you’re either unwilling or incapable of providing them.@TheDozens1 @P1Hood86 He thinks he means well, but he’s been blinded by people with a flawed sense of reality.God can fix that. https://t.co/K9QHukzAm4@P1Hood86 @TheDozens1 There is literally nothing in the Bible about this. He listens to what other people have said and mainly just posts links to articles he tells you to read.

Don’t believe that guy.@ReedRobertson @Englandsr01 @jeff_kaye @TheDozens1 @pitnews Do you have scripture to back any of this up or is it just more rampant conjecture?@TheDozens1 Wait until he gets to Soros.@FisherWritesMLB And yet Joey had to sit.....smh@wfaa Snakes.@TheDozens1 @ReedRobertson @jeff_kaye Tell him to give you a specific verse.@LongHornFrenzy Aggies think if he doesn’t flip today it’s over.@TheDozens1 He and I disagree religiously and pretty much every other way. Nice enough guy, but very strange.@TheDozens1 That guy is special. He has me blocked for challenging him on stuff.@JVillarrealTX @tedcruz Guess I’ll cancel out your vote and put one in for Ted.No thanks, I prefer to keep my rights. https://t.co/DxISJCNLrzBtw...Banny sat Gallo so I’m watching nascar instead.@lesdmitch Can’t wait until Calhoun takes his spot.@RangersBlonde Exactly. I don’t want to see anybody all over each other. I remember a couple at a Six Flags years ago couldn’t stop frenching anc grabbing each other in line.@JaredSandler I mean, I don’t want Rua or Robinson here but we don’t have an option.

But I’m honestly surprised RG hasn’t been sent back and had a platoon of RR/DR in LF.@RangersBlonde I just want people to keep what they do in the bedroom to themselves. You do what you want, but why broadcast it?

We gonna have a “married but interested” day? Or a “I only have one night stands” day? Lol@JaredSandler I get that. I’m just surprised after DD has come back it hasn’t changed.@JaredSandler Yessir. I assumed Joey was our 1B for the next 5-6+ years. 

I know Guzy has been great there defensively, but it’s not as if Joey isn’t. I thought we were told it was Joey’s spot now.

If RG isn’t hitting well enough why is he still taking 1B reps from Joey? Just curious.@JaredSandler You think the Rangers put Joey back soon? Or are they just making him be a LF?@JaredSandler So much for the team focusing on the huge strikeout issue from last year. 

Setting K records around here these days.@MikeLeslieWFAA “My boy!”Is there not anything we can leave politics out of?

Whatever happened to keeping what you do in your bedroom between you and anybody else in there? https://t.co/oBvxUmdRee@Hofinator10 I mean...how is me eating tacos an issue for the SPLC?@Hofinator10 TacoooooooooooosHide and watch... https://t.co/tq6LCiCaIXBanny.......Chris Sale is pitching. I know you know this because you made Gallo sit.

When you have 1st and 2nd base on and 0 outs.....bunt. 

Come on dude. You’re unwillingness to manufacture runs is hurting the team.Replace him with Trey Gowdy please.

Jeff Sessions is a horrible AG. https://t.co/sq5BytjGS0@_rbodenham We have a lot of places here with heavy overpopulation. It’s dangerous for the deer themselves plus the amount of traffic we have on the roadways.

Not to mention, deer is a healthy, low-fat choice for protein.@TheDozens1 @LongHornFrenzy  https://t.co/g6CTY70cpM@LongHornFrenzy It’s the 2nd best city for black people in Texas.@_rbodenham What kind of deer population do you even have in England?@astros_dude I mean...

I hate Houston. I’ve lived there. I think it’s the 4th best big city in Texas.

But using a hurricane picture is digusting.@LongHornFrenzy That’s got to be the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.@_rbodenham Ok, but how? What’s your process to determine what you think that person is?

Pictures? Guns? Name? Location?Curious what you think constitutes a redneck. https://t.co/bEpEkjeAxzYeah it does...it puts food in my kids’ bellies. https://t.co/lSP0qB7RHi@LongHornFrenzy LOL, he’s the bigger person?They’ve lost bowl games to Louisville, Kansas State, and Wake Forest since then.

@chrisgb00 https://t.co/DJIVfdj1ddA former Rangers front office guy is in charge.... https://t.co/vJaHygHsYg@lonestarball So he was good enough to be up last year but not now? 

And this is the same organization that left Herrera uncovered and lost a guy hitting .300 and playing CF well for Philly.@LongHornFrenzy I heard Aggieland was blowing up his phone this weekend.@lonestarball I’m saying if it’s true....then it’s a pretty poor move to sell to the fans.

I already told you I don’t believe he’s as horrible as some people are telling us so we’ll stop asking about him.@AphexCody “Church shot me!”@lonestarball What a great acquisition then, huh.@AphexCody I loooooved Hang Em High. I’ll sit back and chunk grenades all day.@lonestarball He can’t be worse.

Rua and Robinson are killing us. We’re gonna lose 90-100 anyway. So why keep players up who clearly cannot hit in the major leagues?

And yeah, I think we’re being lied to so another issue can get covered up.@KeuchelDBeard I love how celebrities can say something and then have armed guards keep them from the common folk who want to ask them questions.@AphexCody You know you played enough when:

1. You feel calm when you hear this 
2. You also know the sound is the fight music that’s coming soon@lonestarball Well for one, our scouting of who is good and isn’t hasn’t really been great to date. Plus we’ve been lied to plenty when something is really he issue.Smh...no Gallo today. Thanks, Banny.@Frank_is_Fun @Yodacat69 Run to literally any gas station real quickI dig it https://t.co/Ulvwg8OPE7@lonestarball I still just don’t believe he can’t play average LF.@ScottINDIE @TepidP What about the GM who let Doobie go....@KeuchelDBeard 😂😂😂We the People are keeping the NRA active, not politicians. You don’t get it. https://t.co/Q4zQoD84Lb@thelonghorns12 @TheDozens1 Then why is Kyler the starter@TheDozens1 @thelonghorns12 If he does Texas has zero excuses this year.@LongHornFrenzy If it takes this long to choose between Texas and Tech....whatever kid.@diamond_report Not anymore. I’m numb to em now.Just, stop. https://t.co/jmE81ANnyi@EnterStandman @The_Smashley And we could all use a little chaaaaaaaaange.Exactly. I’m sick of CJ talking about himself on the @Rangers telecast. https://t.co/3vyId9RZky@averyfan I’ve spent many a day in Panchos.@HeimBBQ Not surprised lol.@BottomOfDeOrder @Rangers Even then we had it....Claudio and Choo killed us.I absolutely HATE Kimbrel’s dumb arm/wing thingI’m sick of scoring but now the bullpen as cracks. 

Starters going 5 innings is killing us.Blame Choo &amp; Claudio https://t.co/XtHCVeeM8P@justagirlyall @JTillinghouse Six Flags says no.@RangerRedHead Riiiiight there with you chicaThanks, Choo.

Such a liability in the OF.Choo.....smh@BottomOfDeOrder We do that@RangersMania Hahaha noGallo already has 2 HR....I’m afraid the numbers say K here. 

I’m good with a sac fly though.

Come on baby.@LongHornFrenzy There is zero evidence Texas has been doing what Ole Miss has.@BottomOfDeOrder My thoughts too. If Joey can ever hit 250-260 he’s going to be unstoppable.@jake_p84 I’m in@KeuchelDBeard Just for reference....Joey has double the HR of your highest HR player and would have the 2nd highest OPS on your team.@TepidP 😂😂😂😂 I didn’t see this until now.@taddmike Literally forever@dwcashMLB He’s not batting .213 right now. .225 now.@astros_dude He SHOULD have guys on...but we don’t always get on base PLUS Maz has been hitting a lot of HR lately or getting the 3rd out.@astros_dude He was early. Hit a speed bump and Banny put him at 5 or 6. 

I don’t like it but what are ya gonna do.@Landan_Kuhlmann @KeuchelDBeard Thanks.@lonestarball I can happily say I’ve always wanted and pimped Joey Gallo.@astros_dude It’s aggravating him batting 5th. If people were on he’d have 30-40 RBI already lol.

24 RBI so far.@KeuchelDBeard He has 44 K, 12 HR, 24 RBI, 13 BB, OPS .780ish (don’t have updated after 2-3 so far tonight).@KeuchelDBeard He has fewer Ks than Stanton, about the same as Judge.@KeuchelDBeard Be serious.@astros_dude Don’t know. 

Also...not really anything he can do about that.@KeuchelDBeard He has 12 now.Banny mismanaging the pen.

#ThingsAsRegularAsClockworkBanny broke Claudio too?@TepidP That makes me question Texas’ talent scouts even more.TWO FOR JOEY!!!!!!!!@KeuchelDBeard Nah. His Ks are down some. He does already have 11 HR though@KeuchelDBeard Gallo is also gonna have 25 HR by the time the ASG comes. lol@KeuchelDBeard If Gallo played 1B he could....but we gotta send Guzman back down for Joey to go back to 1B.STOP DOING THE WAVE@__lefty7 At least he’s not CJ. All he does is talk about himself.@KeuchelDBeard Joey is good defensively.@KeuchelDBeard So Maz. 

Yeah his avg, HR, RBI, and OPS won’t do it I’m sure.....@__lefty7 Oh please. He does not.@KeuchelDBeard You’re joking. Which one do you not think will?Maz and Gallo will be All-Stars soon.@lonestarball It’s a coffin nail driver@Rangers We love TAG. I learn more about baseball history with TAG on the telecast than CJ. He talks about himself and his own stats more than baseball. 

#BringBackTAG@the_silverfox1 @rmarie717 She’s been drinking all dayThis is disgusting. https://t.co/uokM2c2IlbOne day he’ll get one 500 https://t.co/tOYS6dltSIGallo....my guy https://t.co/Qa4bbAbAGc@LongHornFrenzy Yeah it’s not like he’s gonna tell people ON CAMERA, “yeah I tell em they can’t.”Somebody give these to Drew Robinson. https://t.co/WTdGMIe3hS@stringsays_ Now for a mid-4* and down...I wouldn’t be surprised. 

But either way I don’t care. I just want to put as many of them in a burnt orange Easter basket as possible.@TepidP 😍@stringsays_ I have no idea if he does or doesn’t. 

But not even Saban is gonna cut a 5* loose even if it was real so it’s a non-issue.@TepidP Ariel bowling ok again?@stringsays_ Yeah because he’d say so publicly on camera right...@ledford08 Do they sell things online? 

As long as it’s not actually OSU stuff I’d like to get one for my wife.@TepidP Another 1B/DH type. 

I’m gobsmacked. 

But thanks for the info.@scottmgold @HornsFan29 @LongHornFrenzy  https://t.co/vOE6IgOBHM@TepidP What can you tell us about Cordero playing for DEWD?

Seems he’s in their tweets a lot.@Jeanilou @DLoesch @NRA “On its way out” 

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂@BiasedGirl @DLoesch Yep, I’m blocked too. She didn’t like my opinion about gun-free businesses.@ledford08 Where did you get it?@KeuchelDBeard But you ain’t@ledford08 Is that a crossed-revolvers necklace?@KeuchelDBeard You looking for a beating?@TepidP Takes one to know one.

....couldn’t help it.😏I’m convinced there is NO better country song than “Amarillo by Morning.”

I officiated the funeral of a 38 year old man yesterday who shot himself last weekend. I never want to do that again. There is always another way out. Talk to somebody.@The_Hugo_Black @EricNahlin This is what we think about you every time you have a good September only for October and November to make you cry in your maroon Yetis.Yay https://t.co/d4NyGoAmgm@Ange_lala_La Exactly.@Ange_lala_La Nothing I know of. You didn’t ask for the Rangers to sign Drew Robinson to a long term contract did you?@MBHORNSFAN He can’t pull the offer— no kids would visit him again.@MuayyThaiChick I’d love to go...but my weekend was too busy and I cant. Maybe next year.@lonestarball Why not San Antonio?They really don’t get that this stuff happened in the previous administration....they just didn’t care when he did it because they hated his rivals too. https://t.co/hHVT4iesYp@LongHornFrenzy Never gonna flip from Jimbo.

Yeah....ok, I’ll file that away. Somebody save the screenshot.@RynoAg @stringsays_ If he was 3” taller that wouldn’t have happened.

I’m never taking her to a fancy place again till she hits 40, 45. https://t.co/XUtkX2ZPtQYou really don’t get why they’re speaking?
