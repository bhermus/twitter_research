Former superintendent Bob Dubel and school board member Roger Hayden here.The big question today is whether @S_Dallas_Dance will serve time.@VerlettaWhite survived her first tests with a board that fought and a school system that was under cloud of criminal convictions.White sat at table with board members as they debated her future. She seems to have mastered the ability to remain stone faced and pleasant at the same time.Another night of board members attaching one another over the sup decision.Four members - Julie Henn, Ann Miller, Kathleen Causey and Roger Hayden - votes against White.Board members debated whether waiting a year and having a national search would be better.Verletta White is the new Baltimore County Superintendent by a vote of 8 to 4.Board member Nick Stewart says White is the right person. "There has been no better try out.. She is a leader..she executes with grit and grace."Two board members, Ann Miller and Roger Hayden, say White is not the right person to be superintendent.Baltimore County appears on the verge of getting a new superintendent on a vote now pending before the board.A motion to continue White as an interim superintendent fails.The board was in a long executive session. I am reading the tea leaves here but I think we will learn something tonight.People making comments saying that they want a full national search for a new superintendent.Everyone waiting to find out whether Verletta White will be the next superintendent.Well, there seems to be a lot of tension here in the Baltimore County school board meeting room.Yes, Congrats to Rebecca!! https://t.co/EV4Vl2HwVWWho wouldn't want one of these? https://t.co/te01q8skX9The largest teachers union in the state endorses @BenJealous for governor. https://t.co/E1tBzHO58SIt’s easy to feel disenchanted with Baltimore.

And, oh yes, they also hired that national search firm. But it no longer seemed to be the story.Then, one member recommended just taking a vote to give the job to Interim @VerlettaWhite. That shocked others on the board. Those votes are usually taken in private and announced later.Despite the hour, the board decided to debate whether the search firm Hazard, Young, Attea and Assoc. should be hired. A minority wanted a different firm.Then we all thought the board would simply vote quickly to hire national search firm to conduct the search for the new superintendent. But that was not to be.Yes, after at least a two hour debate, the board approved a $140 million contract to continue the rollout of the laptop initiative that the now unpopular @S_Dallas_Dance began six years ago.To recap a pretty wild Baltimore County school board meeting tonight: Computers in and maybe @VerlettaWhite too.White says back: The numbers are real.And then boos from audience.Now Ann Miller accusing staff of making up numbers. She says, "it is starting to look like Dr. Dance's financial disclosure reports."She was speaking about remarks by Stephen Verch.Henn: "It is incomprehensible that a fellow board member would use this as an opportunity to throw mud."Shouting now at school board meeting between angry members on either side of technology debate.Voted for the motion: Hayden, Miller, Causey and Henn.Motion to delay the vote on the contract fails.Voices of concern about loss of resources to pay for technology.She says a vote to delay is not a no vote but a way for the board to do more thorough job of looking into contract.School board member Julie Henn asks board to delay tech contract vote so board can have work session to discuss it.About 40 people here tonight with t-shirts saying keepmoving forward to get board to approve laptop contract. https://t.co/5LHhKlbUs7Here at the Balto Co school board meeting where lots is on the line re laptops and sup search.Baltimore County's school system is reeling.
