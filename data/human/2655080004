Philosophy left a while back.@Jeff_Weimer @BurbanHillbilly @charlescwcooke thanks. I'll get on it right away. Been fun.@RonkBonk @charlescwcooke And I'm sure there are millions who give a fk about yours. I don't care that you don't care, or that anyone else doesn't care. The fact you're responding clearly indicates you care, or at least are irritated, to which I say, great.@Jeff_Weimer @BurbanHillbilly @charlescwcooke Oh no, not a 'they're coming for our guns' argument. Not even remotely what I was saying.@CarberryMatthew @charlescwcooke color of skin? language they speak? nationality? pretty sketchy argument.@Jeff_Weimer @charlescwcooke Clever enough. I return to original salvo: 2nd A and it's simplicity does not convey unfettered rights to 'keep and bear'. And if the right is not unfettered, can it not be limited, restricted? Does a toddler have to be 'proven' not capable of exercising this right, for example.@FarmerPerky @charlescwcooke Sure, should be the same in Miami, NYC, Everywhere! MAGA - My Attorney Got Arrested (and recorded!).@BurbanHillbilly @Jeff_Weimer @charlescwcooke Sorry, can't respond to a wall, which is what this argument would be. We control access to cars a heck of a lot more than guns, and are quicker to take that access away. Fuck it; you go your opinion, I got mine. Bye Felecia.@EDMLive @DonJohnsonthe2 @charlescwcooke And like yours is? LOL.@Jeff_Weimer @charlescwcooke I have no hoplophia against responsible gun owners/concealed (or maybe even open) carriers. It's the dumb ass, irresponsible ones I don't care for, and there are MILLIONS of them. So how about a little more care and due diligence about who gets to own, and carry them.@DonJohnsonthe2 @EDMLive @charlescwcooke We're 'compelled' to follow and obey the Constitution, and many laws, that you don't 'feel' are legit. Again - follow closely here - in my view there is NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to open carry. Ergo, it can be banned.@JoeSilverman7 so, where do you 'draw the line'? The line will keep getting pushed and, next you thing you know, tank drivers with bazookas.@JeffreySluder @charlescwcooke well, you know pursuit of happiness thing kind of bleeds into it. 'Keep and bear' does NOT automatically imply 'open' and 'unlimited.' And far smarter people than you or I - Constitutional scholars I believe they're called - agree. And disagree.@Jeff_Weimer @charlescwcooke got it. terrific movie@beneat_john @charlescwcooke It's family's. So fuck your illiteracy. Many gun owners are irresponsible dumb asses. And I found one!@Jeff_Weimer @charlescwcooke who the fk said I was afraid? Rational? You're going to lecture on rational? Good one.@USMCRogue People who insist on self-identifying as 'Christian' and 'patriot' are rarely much of either. And why in the fk would I want to know anything else about you.

Porn Again Christian (like trump) or one of the other types?@Jeff_Weimer @charlescwcooke The name's David and I'll 'calm down' when you pry my cold, rational thought from by hard, protected head. Keep and bear everywhere? Bullshit I say and Constitution says I can say it.@charlescwcooke Any recommended reading on the 2nd Amendment, yours or otherwise?@charlescwcooke How 'bout a constitutional argument for states denying carry permits, open or otherwise. And, can a business, private or otherwise, constitutionally deny carriers, open or otherwise, access. I yield to someone much (I presume) smarter and well versed on the subject.@EDMLive @charlescwcooke I don't fear it; just don't like it and can't see why it's necessary, much less 'guaranteed.' And where does it stop? If you can open carry a pistol, why not other stuff?@charlescwcooke Don't see how open carry is so obviously included in 2nd A, which many seem to believe. It's uncomfortable for many others, but, fk their rights/feelings? Is a bazooka okay to open carry? Shit, drive a loaded tank down the street; no problem: 2nd!@Brett_McMurphy No Beano?

Please.@rkylesmith trump 'refused to play the game'  'cause he was going to get his ass handed to him, as bad as Meyers did. Instead the coward sent female toadies to absorb it.
