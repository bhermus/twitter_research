My life is so wonderful. 💙👶🏼Little dude was so cooperative last night 🙌🏻 we are so lucky to have such a good baby! 👶🏽🍼💙 @SithLordShoeI think I slept for like 4 hours last night (the most since Sunday) and I feel like a new human. Who knew you could function on such little sleep?? The newborn baby squeaks and snuggles make it so worth it though 💙👶🏽😌Today was the most perfect day 💙For the love of god.... no, there is no baby yet. I will tell the whole world when he arrives, trust me!With a little bit of aspirin and a lot of love from mom and dad, Max is feeling much better 🙌🏻❤️🐕@alybakeacake ❤️❤️❤️ I love you!!!I hope Xander never hurts himself or ever even gets a cold bc my heart is breaking watching my dog in pain from who knows what 😢Left for work and Max was fine.... came home and he can’t stop crying. He hurt his leg somehow. My dog literally broke himself while he was alone 🙄😐Seeing people who were due after me holding their babies is making me veeerrry jealous@SquidneyO 11 days or less 🙌🏻We get to meet our tiny human this month 👶🏼💙🎉🍼Whoever invented call of duty..... I don’t like you and we are not friends 🙄I managed to sleep for more than one hour increments last night so today has to be a good day 😬Most Monday of all the Monday’s 🙄☹️MIL brought us TEN boxes of Girl Scout cookies. Pregnant me says this is awesome, but I know that not pregnant me will not like this in a few weeks. 😬Mood: https://t.co/E4Ac17tMQJXander likes to poke his limbs out and I push them back into place just for him to poke them out again. Can’t tell if he is playing or just really stubborn 🧐@SEARSlythough https://t.co/UKAguaEXSN@SquidneyO Nice! Layovers less than an hour are scary.I haven’t really missed alcohol my whole pregnancy but good lord I think I could use a bottle (or 2) of some good wine right now 😬🍷🍷@SquidneyO Is that even possible to make??@SithLordShoe https://t.co/9TGo0oqRhlWore my hair down for a hot sec at work and the patients literally didn’t recognize me 😂Remembered to grab my moms birthday card but not my work badge when I left for work this morning.... I amaze myself sometimes 🙂One day I won’t have bags under my eyes. Probably in about 15 years, but I’m holding onto hope 😴My tweets on Timehop from my freshman year of college never fail to make me laugh. We were strange humans @AHubbaBubba 😂😂Some days I feel like Max is so perfect I don’t deserve him. Other days he pees on my carpet. Luckily for me, today he has been perfect. 💙🐕Matt got an Xbox today and I already want to smash it into a million pieces 🎮🤦🏻‍♀️I love feeling Xander kick and move but I am so happy that I get my lungs back all to myself in 8ish weeks 🙂 #cantbreatheXander must know all of this stuff I’m putting away is for him because he seems to be having a party for one in there! Can’t wait to meet my sweet boy 💙It’s baby shower day!!! 👶🏼🍼🎊@STEINBERG5 @SithLordShoe This person actually spelled it ‘Jani’. I’m still confused 🤷🏻‍♀️It baffles me when people are on my Facebook account and still can’t spell my first name right 🙂Literally this cat made me want to eat a cinnamon roll. Pregnancy is strange https://t.co/MuMYg4Z8P4Max just hopped up in the recliner with me until he was laying on the baby and started getting kicked in the head 😂 glad the children are getting along alreadyTo say I am hangry is an understatement@mommma_becky The one you got him is no where to be found so I think he destroyed it hahaha this is the one he had that he is carrying aroundMax has been carrying his bone around room to room and it’s probably the cutest thing I’ve seen 🐕❤️Having the day off after you get home from vacation is great until all you wanna do is snuggle your dog and sleep and there are 83727 errands that need to be runBoston has been fun but I am SO excited to sleep in my own bed and snuggle Max@fodefosho Yeah she sent a pic. Hoping it works tomorrow night 😬Momma Becky went into Momma bear mode and has obtained the ID but no way to get it to Boston before tomorrow. Hopefully the bar we have plans at feels bad for the pregnant lady who can’t drink anyway 😬😬😬Literally the worst dayWelp. ID is in KC and I am currently in Detroit on our way to Boston. This seems all too familiar.  Happy New Year 🙄🙄HAHA on an airplane and can’t find my ID may never leave BostonFlying stresses me out 😐😐😐Everytime I see a dog I miss Max 😢10ish weeks until we get to hold our little guy 😭 pregnancy is so fast but so slow at the same time.“Oops I drank all of your wine” -my husband to my mother

It’s so annoying!!We literally pay for a reserved spot in our shitty parking lot and Matt is so nice that he won’t have people towed who park there because he wants to “give them a chance” 🙄I wish we owned a huge giant house and I would just take all the dogs from shelters and love them ❤️ if we weren’t getting a new human soon I would most definitely take advantage of KC Pet Projects free adoption special today 🐕❤️Okay I tweeted that before I drank the glucose drink.. it really wasn’t that bad tbhMaking a pregnant girl fast to take labs and then drink a nasty glucose drink is really just cruel 🤢Matt came home with my two favorite ice cream flavors and ugh I just love him so much 😭❤️Literally thought my phone was broken because no videos were playing with sound... until I realized my Bluetooth headphones were still connected🤦🏻‍♀️ #2017@Krohndog So close to being done forever!!!
