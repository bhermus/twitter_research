@kskaggs15 answer your texts@DannySallee Do tellüòÇ https://t.co/ToLEVorjUd@KySportsRadio maybe Lebron gains the weight in body fluid from the activity.  Like knee fluid buildup?I remember watching Malik Newman at Hoopfest.  He's come a long way.üòÇ https://t.co/CiTGfvUmMoNot upset about the loss as much as I am the conversations I'm going to have to struggle through tomorrow with people who couldn't point out a üèÄ in a lineup.We are not supposed to win this game.  Pretty obvious at this point.@JamesDKendall Too much: 

Fouls
Missed FT by PJ
Turnovers
KSU 3'sSGA brought us here and is now taking us home.@adamhayden22 Get nakedThe planets are aligning.  Exceeded my expectations over the last month.  Good job boys.@CBSSportsCBB @MattNorlander Good@FormMorm @JeffBidwellShow @JoeJack74 Nothing crazy.  Isn't what they said as much as how it was said.  I was just a little surprised considering their audience.@JoeJack74 @JeffBidwellShow I appreciate both sides of every topic as a UK fan. Your show provides that, and I also enjoy UK constantly in everyone's mouths, negative or positive. I just want your show to continue long term.C'mon guys, you get listeners because you open for KSR on 99.5.  Don't run your entire audience off, bad business decision. @JeffBidwellShow @JoeJack74What an idiot. https://t.co/T1WKyI0wUQ@adamhayden22 @Scoggs23 Probably best if it isn't discussed@Scoggs23 and now it's gone üò≥ https://t.co/kKQXMKzGY1@SeanSutton4 It took UT losing, I couldn't have been ok losing to them in the E8.  I can live with CincinnatiIt's officially to the point that I cannot be disappointed with any possible result for UK the rest of the way.DO. NOT. TALK. TRASH.One thing about a tourney run, we'll probably go from losing two guys to the NBA to losing four.We put their only only big man on the bench with 3 fouls and then magically all four of our big men have 2-3 fouls.I'm shakingDo you remember where you were when the first 16 beat a 1?@JamesDKendall We don't hang banners and shelve trophies for three pointers.@DannySallee If they shoot 15/30 from 3 two games in a row I'll tip my cap and watch Keldon Johnson videos all summer.I am 29 years old and I have witnessed UK play a game without hitting a 3 ONE TIME.If I have to pick 1 of the first 2 games to struggle, it's this one.3 PT Streak is going to end. Crazy stuff.üíÄüòµ@MRudolphComedy  https://t.co/kSa1ePrrMIRemember it like yesterday 

@snow_nicole @bsnow0 @Scoggs23  @FormMorm @kskaggs15 @CheezeMonsta https://t.co/uif8pYCjOkSEC tourney was fun.Haha Oklahoma in but no Louisville.@ChrisFisher247 5/12 with Murray St. is going to ruin it for us WKY fans.PJ is gonna be so good next season.üòÇ https://t.co/GE8rfmAhEMWinner. Not even close. https://t.co/3Y13VaPU2QNow THIS is amazing. https://t.co/Jeq3KaGfqR@DrewFranklinKSR @KySportsRadio These guys wonder daily where the negativity comes from inside the UK fan base.@SethDavisHoops You think a team that has played 95% man all year can throw out a "good zone?"  Ok then.@jrod__11 Y'all nice todayBest half Florida has had all year.  Who didn't expect that? üòÇ@EPHolt @adamhayden22 Which one is supposed to be me?@G2_Blog Seems to be a popular path these days@SeanSutton4 I think we'll be better than them when we play. End of the year?  We'll see@SeanSutton4 Rather play them first than lastUL fans desperately trying to equate today's news with their dumpster fire the past two years. https://t.co/RUlEhyqngzAnd the majority of fans won't care one bit about all of this.  Involving everyone will water it down so much that it gets forgotten in a year or less. https://t.co/CkuLTow9HUCollege programs are no longer judged based off of clean/dirty.  Now it will be less dirty/more dirty.@MGH859 Video games must be outlawed in all the other countries üôÑ@JeffBidwellShow and @JoeJack74 has turned into the UL apologist hour and I am üòÇ

Asked @ryanlemond if he should be throwing stones with the FBI scandal on the horizon.  Classic.I'll never forget UK's bye game in the 2012 Final Four.  Huge opportunity to rest up for the championship game.We went to Jared!There's a part of me in that seat that I'll never get back.  Which is why I have a hard time getting too concerned about the way this UK season is going.  Go Cats. https://t.co/5G7HL3ocJC@snow_nicole We went to Nashville today for Valentine's Day. I purposefully haven't paid attention. Just check score every so often.  Looks like a good thing I'm not.@ericcrawford It's called being a traffic/click whore.  Happens every day. https://t.co/NnMnIpjQGh@JoshAnderson89 I almost put that in my tweet, I agree.This is great. https://t.co/fjLKs3IWX6That camera shot of the Rupp crowd flat out makes me embarrassed to be a UK fan.@EPHolt @zachladd @adamhayden22  https://t.co/sAfiB8OPMBThread üíØ https://t.co/cdxA94qj5G@collinthashotz Most of the reason why I'm about to smash this suckerI promise to share a picture of my remote in pieces in about 8 minutes.Give this video guy all of the money. https://t.co/4rhe4Jf906@leaux1231 Here lately he's awake the whole time.  Enjoy the 30 naps a day while they are still coming.@leaux1231 Talked to your parents at Cracker Barrel the other day.  They said the little one is doing great.  Good to hear!@leaux1231 He called the game lol. Referring to those with an obvious bias against UK.  (There are many)I almost tweeted about how a big chunk of national media are quiet after UK's win. Then I remembered I'm blocked by some and unfollowed the rest.@zachladd @adamhayden22 @TwitlessBlake UK/UL Sweet 16 game in 2014 for meWorth mentioning that this all happened with a no-show from my favorite and arguably our best player PJ Washington.@FormMorm üç∫@G2_Blog I was throwing reverse psychology out the entire first half üòèüòè https://t.co/YVlh6bzCzRThat's this UK team for you.  Just enough to give you a taste, but never enough to get you full.Do we have enough room for all these players and next year's freshmen?üö£@ReidForgrave @CBSSports @CBSSportsCBB Hard unless you're John Calipari.That would be a dream. https://t.co/Bez3bzQQWB@Scoggs23 I unfollowed long ago, but I somehow end up RT'ing him every now and thenSomeone keep an eye out for the Monstars at the UK game. https://t.co/3wHvjYMdjcI'm glad I get to listen @JeffBidwellShow right before KSR.  It's like watching CNN for two hours and then Fox News for two hours, in relation to UK basketball.@jeffborzello @KySportsRadio @RobDauster So technically there is only one team that you "expect" to win the title.  If any of the others win then it's unexpected.  I look forward to the other 345 articles.Is there another fan base in the world that causes the sane majority to question whether it's worth being a fan in the first place?  That's exactly what 30% of "UK fans" have done for me lately.  The five years after Calipari will be such a reality check.I am so glad I had my first child ahead of this UK football and basketball season.If Duke doesn't win it all next year it will be an epic failure.@Tcope1313 @adamhayden22 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@adamhayden22 "Just hit the rim, just hit the rim"@Scoggs23 Perfect analogyVanderbilt is freaking out.üò¨@adamhayden22 All of em@KyleTucker_SEC I agree.  I just don't think the situations are the same.@KyleTucker_SEC It is going to be IMPOSSIBLE to keep NBA teams from getting scared away from him if this goes much longer.  He's risking millions by not playing too.@zachladd @adamhayden22 I was JUST sitting here thinking how much he's like Goodwin@zachladd Heck of a way to throw @Scoggs23 under the bus.@UofLSheriff50 The kinda foul that awards you 30 free throws?üéÅü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è@Scoggs23 Absolutely. Never be enough dirt to throw on top of that one.The only thing keeping my blue pulse going is remembering I was this mad (even worse) for most of the 2014 season.I am so nearly done with college basketball it's depressing.@G2_Blog You'd never know it though.  With us it's a "fun fact" but any other team it's every other sentence.@Sam_Vecenie Ray Finkled
