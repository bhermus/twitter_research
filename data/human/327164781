I didn’t think I was being theologically accurate in the first place; I just had to get the joke off@Ombudsman_Here @BigWos ah. then where do the other people they don’t like go?@BigWos Ironically, you’d love Mormon Hell, since there are a ton of black people there@talkhoops But if people can’t see you in real life, how would they know that your hair is even fuller in person?@nitzbluv as I tweeted during the event: https://t.co/uFRf3wdLGv@nitzbluv **iconic All Star skills performance@pikachuliu @tomhaberstroh Was literally gonna say the same thing.This is one of the few ways Twitter is better in the 2018 https://t.co/IGXWK5PN9g@PurGooner Yeah. I specified high school in the question only because it’s particularly brazen to do when it’s illegal to have dip in the first place@PurGooner Did they spit into a water bottle? Cause if not, that’s not real southern dippin@songofsungs Sounds reasonable@songofsungs That’s fair. I’d recommend eating something, but I’m gonna die early the way I eat, so my advice should not be followed@songofsungs Didn’t get a hot date to Five Guys, I seeEvery movie would be better if Denzel played Denzel in it.Denzel Washington plays himself in every movie and that could not be less of a bad thing.@elblancojz @doctor_krieger Hahahahaha. Never bothered trying. Probably because I didn’t play any sports and it’s not like members of the Academic Team were pressuring me to dip.@elblancojz @doctor_krieger Well, no, because I want to see how many of my followers are from Florida in that case lol@doctor_krieger I’m from Florida (and not the nice part) so that’s why I ask.@NStampar Yeah. That’s what I’m trying to feel outI need to get a feel for my follower-base: did you ever see a fellow student dip while in high school?@TSoss Yes. But I am absolutely not the arbiter of cool@nitzbluv You mentioned turning up in the east village on your last NYC weekend, and since I live there: I’ll be there@nitzbluv Big agree.@neez_god_ski I’m more of a whiskey guy so I chose derby over cinco de mayo.I am really not looking forward to LeBron trouncing the Celtics.@neez_god_ski I agree wholeheartedly. But it isn’t tradition to drink Old Fashioneds on the day of the Kentucky derby.@songofsungs In the same boat. Probably not going to that one@songofsungs You might even meet my very typical, middle-class, white parents@doctor_krieger I made them myself with Maker’s Mark bourbon as per Tom’s recommendation. Didn’t have simple syrup, so I just muddled the mint with some water and sugar@songofsungs  https://t.co/EI5qRDZW2B@danpfeiffer @SheaSerrano If you survived the process, you can survive anything, especially @TVietor08’s weak jabs@CornPuzzle Nothing like a good food sweat@SheaSerrano Would you consider him your most handsome co-worker?@treyzingis 🏃 https://t.co/QankgPHidLJesus Christ, I’m not even done with one and I’m feeling buzzed.

ACE.I can’t be the only one who thinks of Bentley from the Sly Cooper games every time he sees David Fizdale, right? 

Okay, I definitely can be the only one.@Air_Marx Great to know.It is honestly infuriating that British Columbia and Washington have a border, but Vancouver, BC and Vancouver, WA are nowhere near each other.@oliviacraighead a personal fave in the genre: https://t.co/66ZaJiEBuV@DamianTrillard You don’t get the capital-J in “Journalist” for nothin’@DamianTrillard Wait, I thought all postgame questions had to begin with “talk about…”@mjhprep @ESPNNBA @DamianTrillard Yeswhy don’t baseball pitchers ever say sorry when they hit a batter? is there an unwritten rule against it?@bluntcuzicar365 Thank you, but the shirt does say “Pepsi-Cola”TJ MCCONNELL IS THE BEST POINT GUARD ON THE ROSTERhey @Raptors, u like what u see? https://t.co/dDZCGmPVi8YES. Fiz hits my definition of a desirable coach: not Mark Jackson. https://t.co/BaREV1oweM@treyzingis No, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t wear those if they wereIf you think I’m cool at all, know that I’m wearing a Pepsi-Cola t-shirt and red shorts and I consider it an accurate representation of my personal aesthetic.@shaqeemthedream Judge them from afar? Lol@shaqeemthedream I guess I’m talking more about the super zealoty pastors who rail against gay people moreso than the rank and file parishioners@shaqeemthedream I never like to buy into the narrative of “coastal elites” but I let out a huge groan every time I see a celebrity tweet, “How can evangelicals support a president who slept with a…” shit. It’s like: they had no integrity before, so why start now?@BigWos His game screams, “I liked it when they didn’t have so many tattoos.”The telltale sign of someone never having lived in the South is expecting evangelicals to have any sort of moral integrity.@blk_tray I assumed that’s why you weren’t on twitter.@SherwoodStrauss I agree that family leave is a huge winner, but I also think you’re conflating “progressive discourse” with your twitter feed. It’s not like major progressive politicians are publicly calling for the purge of ApuWatch the first episode of my older brother Kevin’s new web series NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS, in which I guest star! https://t.co/CFlbQbfMarALEC BURKS IS A PLAYOFF CONTRIBUTOR@BigBobbyBrand_ I just hope the finals will be competitive@BigBobbyBrand_ Also, I like the Jazz (shouts to @snark_tank)@BigBobbyBrand_ I really don’t like CP3 or Harden so I would prefer that yesI saw someone on the TL say that Giuliani just told Hannity that Trump repaid Michael Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payment, and I thought, “That’s probably an exaggeration.” 

But nope. He said exactly that. Basically unprompted.I really shouldn’t, but I would love for Chris Paul to get bounced in the second round again.thinking about how when Madden had the song “We Made It” by Linkin Park feat. Busta Rhymes, they edited out the word “jail” in Busta’s verse@blackdragonroll @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 I have deleted my text threads since then, but this is not a joke! We didn’t REALLY think he died in the theater, but maybe like 15% of me did@IanKarmel I would like @thegissilent to call me and read the items off a Chinese food menu.Me and @blackdragonroll thought this happened to @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 after he didn’t respond in the group chat on opening night. https://t.co/JDv7ZJZZWyFINALLY. @katienolan should be given all the platforms. https://t.co/4rcxAfo7U5@naima @DynstyBuilder77 Hey, I was gonna say life-changing, but I hate to disappoint@DynstyBuilder77 @naima Lol I think you’ll find our discussion on that topic interesting at the very least@DynstyBuilder77 @naima No thank you and thank you.NEW SORDID HISTORY on BILL COSBY! @naima joined the show, and she is so insightful that this episode was an absolute pleasure. LISTEN. https://t.co/qTVvWxz7nH@j_skav My head knows you’re right, but my heart remains frustrated@treyzingis  https://t.co/C3ZO1Bm0Lp@songofsungs Pizza can really cure any ailment. Except, you know, the ailments caused by eating too much pizza.@JimJimsonJr Certainly. Why I get frustrated is that I think at this point (Donald Trump is the president) we should assume people mean what they say until proven otherwise and not the other way around@songofsungs I ate two slices of pizza (one pepperoni; one white) after watching Infinity War on Thursday and, yes, it helped@JimJimsonJr Yeah. And I think it’s mostly harmless when we get to Kanye, but I guess what’s frustrating to me is that I still see so many otherwise smart people brush off white supremacist accounts as trolls as if white supremacists are not killing folks@JimJimsonJr But anyway, my larger point is that I think too often when we see someone say something that we deem as dumb or ignorant we assume they’re trolling because we don’t want to believe someone could think that and I think that’s a mistake@songofsungs Yeah it hasn’t happened a lot since I moved away from home, but a few months ago, I was eating pizza at a restaurant with some family and I was swept in a beautiful haze and ended up having at least six—not really sure.What this Kanye stuff has made me realize that y’all don’t follow my number one rule of the internet: NEVER assume someone isn’t stupid enough to mean what they say.@JimJimsonJr I just realized I misworded my original tweet so I’ll send it out again, but you’re probably right it’s more complex@songofsungs You ever eating pizza and you’re in such a euphoria you just keep unthinkingly grabbing more slices when you finish one that you don’t realize how many you ate until you ate 5? It’s the best.@snark_tank @talkhoops y’all missed the best name for a Utah team: the Stormin’ Mormons!You don’t need fact-check whether Kim Jong-il got 18 hole-in-ones. It’s patently ridiculous so you can assume it’s false.@rapgamekolek It’s definitely intriguing and I’ll watch a couple at least@rapgamekolek There are two separate musical theater programs, so it’s to be expected.@rapgamekolek Because long before I am a Mets fan I aggressively don’t believe in things beyond the empirically provable (probably should not have answered honestly)The encapsulation of what is wrong with news in the Trump era is that it took his doctor saying his report was dictated for the press to treat it as dictated. Like Jesus Christ. You have brains. You could tell that just by reading it.FOcavaliersUR@JimJimsonJr Lol you’ll never find me doing that.That is Raptors playoff basketball@JimJimsonJr eh, they’re fun but a lot of time they’re lazy and inaccurateI hate narratives about teams that stretch over several years because they’re so rarely accurate. However, the “Raptors are chokers against LeBron” one has too much evidence to ignore.@Jade_Hoye @tomhaberstroh @talkhoops @BigWos @Jerv215 @Rafeboogs Spent the whole pod shaking my head saying, “Wos is a fool.”On top of this, I think there needs to be a much greater public awareness of the lynchings around the turn of the century. People are simply not aware of how readily black people were murdered. https://t.co/DgM7OzvznQ@DragonflyJonez How do we know he even did it then? He was a tiny loser for most of his life in the past. Maybe he hasn’t sniffed it at allKanye tried to tell us he knew nothing about history when he said, “I keep it 300 / Like the Romans.”@SherwoodStrauss @theshrillestif everyone who used “why don’t black people vote republican if they’re not brainwashed?” as a rhetorical device actually asked themselves that question, the world would be 20% less stupid@HaHaChatham Yeah that makes sense.@HaHaChatham I think the Donovan Mitchell vs. Ben Simmons argument is a fun one. I don’t think the semantic one about whether he is a rookie is.@HaHaChatham That’s my point though: Who cares?@wishiwascorbo I like to think so lol@wishiwascorbo yeah, I think outsiders only think of the hamptons and stuff, but obviously there’s much more to it@wishiwascorbo nice. it doesn’t mean much to me, but i like asking specific questions about where people are from lol@wishiwascorbo are you from nassau or suffolk county?@wishiwascorbo no problem. I make fun of it a lot, and there’s not that much to do, but I really do miss the vibe of the state@wishiwascorbo uhhh I’m from like an hour north of there, so I’m not SUPER familiar, but minor league baseball is always a good bet when visiting florida. dirt cheap tickets, relatively cheap alcohol, and always a ton of fun places to hang other than your seats@wishiwascorbo Naples is the crown jewel of the west coast since so many people vacation there lol. There are nice areas, but most of it is like the south mixed with a beach mixed with a midwestern suburb@wishiwascorbo Not many New Yorkers move down to the West Coast. It’s a lot cheaper and not as nice. I’m actually originally from Rockland County, New York, so it was a culture shock to go down there@wishiwascorbo Eh, I’d say that about the East Coasr, but not where I’m from.@wishiwascorbo On Fridays, me and my brothers used to stop at the Circle K to get these things called thirstbusters which were basically big gulps and yes, I agree it just changes your whole day for the better@wishiwascorbo I’ve actually never gotten a double gulp. I have just enough shame not to. I@blackdragonroll @moverby87 @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 @Mariannoo Good call, Jimrome@nitzbluv @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 @blackdragonroll *Anthony impersonating Tessa Thompson voice* “Revengers?”@moverby87 @blackdragonroll @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 @Mariannoo I almost guarantee they cut a line where he explained that he had it for a specific reason. Like that it’s hard to track or something@moverby87 @blackdragonroll @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 @Mariannoo I hope not lol. If you missed that your eyes had to be closed 🤣@Jade_Hoye Wait did I get cut out of this process?!@snark_tank @talkhoops what was the urban legend in your hometown growing up? #SnarkHoops@Apollo2Ares You got it. Monsters.all the other bad parts of Suicide Squad can distract you from just how racist the portrayal of Killer Croc is lol https://t.co/ysSNO0Wy6e@nitzbluv Also, MCU movies almost never exactly follow the comics because they want to be surprising to causal fans and die-hards alike.@cd5476 I’ll give it a shot next time I see it in the store, which might be a while lol@cd5476 I had forgotten that Vernon’s existed until you mentioned it, and that says all you need to know@wishiwascorbo Lol. I try to drink sugar free stuff as much as possible, but I don’t pretend like I wouldn’t love to be drinking a double gulp of a completely unnaturally flavored sugar bomb Mountain Dew that was genetically altered in a lab 😔@wishiwascorbo I am not proud of this fact and I am aware it is super juvenile and will likely negatively affect my lifespan.@wishiwascorbo I prefer Schweppes personally, but not because of the sugaryness of Canada Dry. I also have never thought something was too sugary, so that’s probably why.It might as well just say, “I am miserable to be around.” https://t.co/pcDN2JUXcV@2TireHuffyLord I’m all for brand loyalty, but it has limits.@Vibhishrag I prefer Schweppes the most, but have no qualms with Canada Dry. The only purpose of this tweet is to point out that Seagram’s is bad.What ginger ale do you prefer?@ALSTON2008 Post Malone is for people who think not bathing is a personality trait@ALSTON2008 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/uVIgdZT6WP@Pajaro_Tweets I didn’t see it in 3-D, but I might for my second viewing@Pajaro_Tweets the theater I was in wasn’t particularly non-white, but I think it was super #live because I went to the 7;30 showing on thursday, so everyone was a diehard@MalikJMarshall yes. particularly if I’m reading something engrossing on my phone@Apollo2Ares @blackdragonroll @ACSSPOTLIGHT95 this is an attack@brynak13 thank you! that’s what we’re here for!@elblancojz Exactly! He consistently made all the coolest defensive plays.If I were to open a Hall of Fame of not-all-time-great athletes who hold a special place in my heart, Brandon Phillips would get in on the first ballot, without question.@illdooshay I literally almost spit up my drink at the the ted kennedy joke. a complete and deserved etheringthey can only attack the “civility” of michelle wolf’s jokes because the substance is entirely correct@AminESPN all 5’5 of Earl Boykins ain’t walking through that door #PitinoGame@talkhoops Ok so I did miss something obvious lol@talkhoops This might be a dumb question: but what’s the deal with Brandon Knight? I blinked one second and he doesn’t play anymore. Did I miss something obvious?Hook me up to a polygraph: I have always believed in Thon Maker.
