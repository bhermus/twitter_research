@bvTechie I think it speaks more to how often this guy is in there ðŸ˜‚@bvTechie @a_large_david Cloud of smoke. Smells like cotton candy. The guy looks like someone that would vape@a_large_david Same guy at work every day vapes in the stall. Power moveI've got to be closing in on 1,000 McChickens 

https://t.co/GjksS6OneA@enosarris  https://t.co/sRwaBUaXDm@jeffwzimmerman I wish you were 24 hours late on this tweet :(@jeffwzimmerman Was Prince Fielder benched?@jeffwzimmerman Pablo Sandoval@jeffwzimmerman Rusney Castillo@LaunchAnglePod Rob has said in the past to "ride the hot hand" when filling in for an injured player. He has also said pre-season projections are more meaningful than YTD stats. How does he determine who the "hot hand is?"@batflipcrazy Francisco Cervelli
Evan Gattis@Nick_Friar Hey Nick, you know you posted this on Twitter and not via email?

Seriously though, the @KenLairdWEEI hot take schtick is getting a little tired @bradfo@masnKolko Any word on Rendon's status? Or any word on WHEN we'll know Rendon's status? Thanks!@jeffwzimmerman I think you got your wires crossed...Cueto over Polanco?@jeffwzimmerman Would you trade him for Gregory Polanco?@GreekGodOfHops @_darkman44 Don't take this the wrong way, but if Cameron is a horse then you're a donkeyThis is so freaking good https://t.co/uFdEarbWk3@Soxlunch You forgot about Pau Gasol@EvanDrellich @bradfo  https://t.co/ZAW9Tqu90L@LaunchAnglePod @RobSilver @jeffwzimmerman Does Gregory Polanco have any hope at batting over .250? I know Rob is down on him. Please discuss@maxbmargolis @LaunchAnglePod @RobSilver @jeffwzimmerman Seconded@EvanDrellich @bradfo You better. That LA trip isn't going to pay itself...

Thanks@EvanDrellich @bradfo I believe one of you mentioned interviewing Levangie about the staff-wide drop in velocity and him not being concerned. Link?@DolphHauldhagen Saul Goodman. Ended up starting both and sitting a reliever. Still getting the hang of weekly rosters@jeffwzimmerman *shallow league. Thanks!@EthanMills29 @jeffwzimmerman Blocked@jeffwzimmerman Would then need to sit one of Nola  vs ATL or Mccullers vs OAK@jeffwzimmerman start Taillon home vs DET or Snell at BAL this week? Thanks!@DolphHauldhagen would you rather start Snell at BAL or Taillon home vs DET this week?@DolphHauldhagen Have you messed with Sean Lahman's DB? I also use SQL at work but for some reason (laziness) have never actually used it for baseball related stuff, even though I know it would make me so much better at SQL@DolphHauldhagen I used stata for an econometrics class in college 7 years ago and to this day still get random nostalgia for it. Do you use SQL or just download/manipulate in Excel?@DolphHauldhagen Btw, what're you using to run your regression analysis?@DolphHauldhagen This was really good.@jeffwzimmerman @RobSilver @ManlyVanLee could you guys discuss strategies in a weekly league in a future pod? I.e. deciding between 1 start #2 starters vs 2 start #4 starters? Thanks!@soxmoneyball People over process...the first value of Agile@enosarris would be interesting to hear if opposing hitters look for the curve less in Coors.@OverTheMonster Literally just finished rewatching the 8th@kidnotor @enosarris @sporer @fantasywiener ...no. still Devers@jeffwzimmerman It's ESPN, so it's probably going to be a terrible rule@jeffwzimmerman doing weekly league for the first time with Sunday night waivers. Lamet is not on my DL yet (because of weekly rosters). Will I need to drop someone else in order to pick up a new player tonight?@RobSilver @jeffwzimmerman You guys should discuss on the next pod. @ManlyVanLee@DolphHauldhagen @RotoGut Watch this: https://t.co/ZdQdWVyVE8

Bugs Bunny changeup@DolphHauldhagen @RotoGut Have you watched Chirinos pitch? Pretty nasty@jasoncollette &lt;after 15 minutes of this&gt; "yeah, so I'm going to need to elevate this to our Level 2 help desk"@theScore Tell the tooth! https://t.co/86MGZ4kQZs@rebeccagracev #shiplap@DolphHauldhagen Literally wrote DON'T PRICE ENFORCE on a piece of paper next to my computer to remind myself. Only did it once and got Domingo...oh well@enosarris Archer, McCullers, Castillo, Lamet, Morton, Salazar, Nelson, Mikolas. Did I accidentally create the biggest boom or bust rotation of all time? 12 teams@DolphHauldhagen This is my first slow draft in years. For someone who is an uber over-analyzer and indecisive this is killing me. I am Chidi from The Good Place@DolphHauldhagen Is archer in that category for you? Considering double dipping and then waiting on pitching@DolphHauldhagen 12 teams. 5th spot. I get self conscious when I stick to my ranks and get down voted on my picks :(12 teamer, 5th draft spot (yuck)@DolphHauldhagen Blackmon, Jose Ramirez, Donaldson, Greinke...have I blown my slow draft thus far or crushed it?@LarsFossel @alexspeier @GaryMalec Actually tell him the other LARS ANDERSON says hello @Tweet2Lars@RobSilver Maybe it's because Jays fans have listened to him talk and assume his demeanor will get in the way of his potential?@LaunchAnglePod That makes much more sense...I figured lineups were set Sunday night not Monday on the 1st game.@LaunchAnglePod So if weekly pickups in a weekly roster league...are players added before rosters are set? I.e. can you add a player on Sunday and insert him into your lineup for that week? Thanks for the response@LaunchAnglePod My home league is switching to weekly rosters, but we are currently daily pickups. Is it standard to ALSO have weekly pickups in a weekly roster league. Or is it standard to do daily roster pickups (whether FA, waivers, or FAAB)? Do you guys have a preference?@Nick_Friar That's his expectation or yours? It seems like he is a little delusional@Nick_Friar How much PT is he expecting to get?@Nick_Friar Good stuff, Pitcher Nick@PitcherList FYI Faria's hyperlink on the Top 60 page takes you to https://t.co/gumZcqQnuy but should point to https://t.co/nbhUGACir2@kerrylowell https://t.co/IEORhgDimZ@enosarris Since when did you become a professional photographer@bradfo Don't you have a bet with someone that you could catch his knuckler?@enosarris @EVPerryHusband Dan's HBT article you originally tweeted references this HBT article (https://t.co/ywrOYLWjni) by Jon Roegele. In Jon's article he references Perry and his work, which is described in more detail here: https://t.co/Qa5hMC51zQ and here https://t.co/crugm3GqZ8@EVPerryHusband @enosarris I totally understand. I first heard about effective velocity from Doug Thorburn, who credited you. I wanted to bring it to Eno's attention because he is always curious to learn@enosarris @EVPerryHusband Actually after reading his last 6 tweets it's pretty clear his thoughts on the subject@enosarris @EVPerryHusband I probably should read the article before I chime in. Curious to hear Perry's opinion@enosarris Is pitch tunneling different than EV?
@EVPerryHusband@DolphHauldhagen  https://t.co/H7oyIgxtC5@longenhagen @OverTheMonster His changes are covered here: https://t.co/C2AUnzP5xP@jeffwzimmerman What's the equivalent for JD Martinez? Assuming Sox lineups have been factored in@kerrylowell https://t.co/lKzdmt0NdI@smartfantasybb @DolphHauldhagen I've always figured...only x amount of humans can throw "hard"...and there are 9 times as many righties as lefties in the world, so odds are fewer lefties would be able to throw "hard"@bradfo @EvanDrellich @WEEI Is Evan holding you hostage? Blink twice if so@Tweet2Lars @YouTube Watching gameshow fails on YouTube is a good way to waste 6 hours of your time@enosarris No, but the Royals are. #Hosmer #Moustakas #nerrrrrd@BattingStanceG Have a team wrecking day?@bradfo  https://t.co/HYPuvSqxeP@EthanMills29 @ESPNFantasy Hey ESPN don't tell me what to do@enosarris @TheAthleticMLB @TimBritton actually, i am commanding you to do it@enosarris @TheAthleticMLB my vote is for @TimBritton@bradfo Oh, ok. So has a decision already been made that he will be in the pen? So long as he's starting to "build down" and not as an audition of sorts@bradfo This doesn't seem very clear. Why even have him pitch a few times as a starter if he's destined for the bullpen?@soxmoneyball This is great, although it takes time for my brain to adjust to red being good, green being badYes. https://t.co/itcSUlgNjA@TimBritton @TheAthleticNYC Selfishly, sad to read this; although, I was very relieved to see you covering the Mets and not Yankees so I can still follow you. Congrats!@ByJayKing I now follow Carrie Underwood (accidental click, don't know how to unsubscribe), Dude Perfect, and MassLive Celtics@bradfo turns out saving the Kelly/Porcello @Bradfo_Sho podcast until today was a good idea@SammyReidFI Cat is laying on me #LazinessIn5Words https://t.co/IPMfMYNUWX@JosephKellyJr Oh boy, the smart money is officially invested@sporer @JustinMasonFWFB Rags to riches story. From commenting on the Towers of Power Facebook group to co-hosting its off-spring podcast@enosarris Where do I vote? Fangraphs tweet link is broke@enosarris eduardo rodriguez? who says no@ByJayKing C- tweet. The grammar is way too good@GoliathandI What is there to celebrate?@RobSilver @SammyReidFI The key to his true breakout is if the new hitting coach can convince him to get a bit more lift on his batted balls@TimBritton #FreeSwihart@james_vanm #deflategate@MikeGianella @rudygamble Especially if you are in an inconvenient spot like a meeting or check-out line at the groceries. Double the pressure@MikeGianella @rudygamble There is something to be said about needing to decide on the fly which player to drop as soon as news breaks that there is a closer change@GoliathandI https://t.co/ZI1k2XtPX9@WendtLuke Come on, that's Office trivia 101@ByJayKing Have you watched their Facebook show?

I'm assuming Eno is going off of his coast to coast speed. My point is most runners beat Bolt at that distance@enosarris NBA court is 15 meters. Bolt is rarely out in front by then@ArchAngel97 Looks more like Mose from the Office https://t.co/WRJvulGO9v@JaredJaredDeame "Maybe I misunderstand it so I'm going to either give him the benefit of the doubt based on every other thing he's ever said OR I'll reach out to him for clarification before blasting him."

Most people watch from P's POV@DolphHauldhagen That wasn't why. It makes a good excuse though@enosarris Question I've always had though... why do you prefer heatmaps from catchers POV?
