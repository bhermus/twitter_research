This is beautiful https://t.co/161FDdqgEm@DishDeez Lmaooo he had to score more than his playoff average to sitLMAOOOO CAVS ARENA IS PLAYING GOD’S PLAN RIGHT NOW 😂😂😂Guess Bron hit his benchmark. Called for that sub immediately after the made jumper.Blowup the whole team https://t.co/DhfSPqvjS2@DishDeez He gotta hit 35 points before he sit down lmaoo 25 not enoughBron about to run up the score and they already up 30 lmaoo take a rest man@BarackOBoogie Yea nah they would prob go for one of them though. Zach Lavine can’t have the franchise tag lol@Rodneyj_ You gotta relax lolWhoa he got ejected? Yikes@BarackOBoogie Knicks. Shit Bulls could use them too lmaooKyle Lowry and Demar Derozan going will be on the trade market this postseason. Remember this tweet. This is ridiculous.@The_Steezo 👀 idk bro, we gone see lmaoooHe covered in vibranium dust https://t.co/9bNHeOh5hTCavs are playing greattt. 5 players in double digit scoring. Bron not having to shoulder the close out loadTold y’all https://t.co/1nuk52NVPDPassive Lebron for the first half, aggressive Lebron in the second half. Watch@k_Sole94 Him too over Murray and Ingram@THESEAINTJOKES_ Agree to disagree. To the original point. Rookie Mitchell has established himself as nearly a franchise player. Sophomore Ingram hasn’t. 24/6/4 hasn’t been produced by Ingram over any 5+ game stint in his career so far and Mitchell is doing that on the biggest stage. Playoffs.@THESEAINTJOKES_ Ehhh not necessarily. You also have D. Book at 6’6 on this list who’s pretty much just a pure scorer. Him and Donovan would thrive in any SG role. Also I wouldn’t get too hung up on height. Wade is a 1st ballot HOF at 6’4...Westbrook as well@THESEAINTJOKES_ I mean Kyrie only score but I’m taking him over an all-around pg like Mike Conley no hesi. If you scoring at an elite level in the right system that could be enough. If I’m a GM right now, give me Donovan over IngramI’m jacking Tatum and Mitchell over Ingram https://t.co/baHveZhUMK@WhiteWomenYuck @JahBearBear Y’all ain’t right man lolJaylen Brown is prob the best defensive matchup for Bron, but he’s 100% healthy so I’m just trying to figure out who’s keeping Bron out the paint. https://t.co/zhgl1UXax9Try harder https://t.co/CFC9jBhUAX@daeshvwn Lmaooooo @ check engine light.
