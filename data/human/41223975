@karia_beth14 Very nice!@charlescwcooke But did he give you his opinion on the major political questions of the day?@IntenseEnergies @ThomasHCrown Chang and Eng Bunker were ahead of their time, clearly.@WilliamAyers Served honorably for peace by committing acts of domestic terrorism?@AG_Conservative @charlescwcooke “Some may see a politician with a crystal meth addiction, but all we see is his readiness to answer 3 AM phone calls.”My week on Twitter 🎉: 6 Mentions, 84 Likes, 1 Retweet, 605 Retweet Reach, 4 New Followers, 6 Replies.

That’s the really exclusive club.@MattWelch @GovBillWeld I’m not interested in a “Libertarian” who shills for Hillary Clinton *while on a ticket that’s running against her*.Good thread: https://t.co/YpuWb3aYqC@tc0pe Also, why don’t they just cut his arm off instead of prying the gauntlet off his hand?@tc0pe I was thinking the same thing.@jay_jaffe @MattWelch Should’ve never left STL. But then, I’m biased.@BuckSexton @TomRtweets I can't believe you both forgot "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance".@AustinKellerman @FOX16News @Wess_Moore @Ben_CreightonTV I still don't understand how a possum makes any sense as a Travs mascot.@FrankelJeremy @realDailyWire I’ve noticed that as well.  Just looking at episode numbers, I’m guessing he took a break.@BorlandTully you should check this out. It’s long, meandering, and you won’t agree with all of it, but it’s a really interesting discussion. https://t.co/JzjMiNcDXs@GerardAraud The country never signed anything. We have a procedure for that. It wasn’t followed.@jrrdodson It looks like all those years as a τεκτων are paying off for Jesus.@notwokieleaks But how do you run a tech company if you fire the IT staff?@ekp [sarcasm] Well, yeah, because tech guys are nerds. It's not like they can just fire 90% of the IT department. [/sarcasm]  But really, what are you suggesting? That tech CEOs put some hookers on staff or something?@RealKentMurphy @karia_beth14 I’ve been those red kids. It’s not fun, but there are worse places to get hit with a ball.@JonahNRO @benshapiro Wait, how is it 5 on the list of hardcovers but 4 on the combined list? That sounds backwards, but I’m guessing there’s just something I don’t know about how NYT does their book lists.@DavidAFrench You’re the only person I know who likes the NBA and WoW.@FreeSoilAndrew Half true is probably pretty good by politician standards, honestly.@danpfeiffer So as long as an intern wrote the hit piece, it’s immune to criticism? Cool story bro.@EsotericCD @andylevy Look: https://t.co/VJBcQxcwhr@EsotericCD @andylevy Is it just me, or does the doctor in the picture look like the Area 51 scientist from Independence Day?@AviWoolf @RAVerBruggen had an interesting thread on that: https://t.co/RDcMfR3on2Interesting thread. https://t.co/2NR45wJEpwGood thread on the Iranian nuclear program. https://t.co/bfUdk5x7WR@Neoavatara @EsotericCD The Huns will pay for the Lusitania!Good thread. I’d never heard any of this before. https://t.co/rFqWEj5gQx@continetti Do we know it was a raid and not, say, a hack?Did he also tell them that the sky is blue, or that water is wet? https://t.co/HZYotGH46M@RedHotSquirrel @karentraviss Isn’t that the point though? An unelected upper house of a bicameral legislature seems designed to check a more populist lower house. That’s how it worked in the US, until the 17th Amendment provided for direct election of Senators (previously appointed by state legislatures).@EsotericCD Hawley hasn't won the primary yet.  This might be a good reason to have a less traditional candidate like @AP4Liberty on the GOP side; he's harder to tie to Greitens.@JayAlver @JerryDunleavy @OwnTheLibsBot Oh I know that, I’ve just never heard what the actual *content* of the speech was. Could’ve been three hours of rambling about his military career, for all I know.@EsotericCD I think Coolidge was pretty fascinating, but maybe I’m just an odd duck. Also Jefferson and TR. (Yes, I know both were before your time. Even so.)

As to Grant, wasn’t his “autobiography” ghostwritten by Twain? Twain could make 400 pages on drying paint interesting.We need another president like “Silent Cal”. https://t.co/8od7IWLT0f@PrezCoolidge may want a word here. https://t.co/UiHiZHVTFm@JerryDunleavy @OwnTheLibsBot How much did William Henry Harrison promise?@3rdDegreeNet I so wish @FCDallas could make this happen. https://t.co/85cKoqVuaV@3rdDegreeNet NYC has a peculiarly strong home field advantage because of their baseball field. And they *are* the best team in the East. I’ll settle for 3-1.I’ve seen seen @CBSCoachNutt at my alma mater a few times. He spoke at Chapel once, and his brother is the men’s basketball coach, so he comes to home games occasionally. https://t.co/rthlW8LWG0@daumkeziah There’s nothing wrong with anything you did. Nothing at all to feel bad about.@EsotericCD @varadmehta As an American citizen, that makes me Native American, right?@DavidPaulJenner @EsotericCD Apparently we’re all POC now. Native Americans.@koribullard33 You should run for President on this platform.Thread: https://t.co/aJflxWuPSj“O my Strength, I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.”
Psalms 59:17 ESV@JonahNRO I'm surprised you can find that much nature in NYC. Or were you upstate somewhere?@molratty @Patriot_Musket @7kfair @VixenRogue @Bmac0507 “Movie theater”My week on Twitter 🎉: 28 Mentions, 63 Likes, 10 Retweets, 76.3K Retweet Reach, 2 New Followers.

Seems backwards.@scottlincicome Is a hot dog a taco?@realBenWorley I’m single and almost 30.  It’s step parent or uh, make millions and attract a trophy wife? Since I’m going into education, probably the the former.“in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?”
Psalms 56:11 ESV@stevenmklein Was he wrong, though? Direct democracy kind of sucks. Sparta was a Republic, like a real country.

(This tweet should not be taken as constituting approval of helotage, pederasty, etc)@ijumpedthegun Don’t worry, they’ll let him fall right past.@charlescwcooke @varadmehta @BlueBoxDave I’m not sure it’s true of New Yorkers as a group either, to be honest.@DavidAFrench Great barbecue too (at least in the Memphis area), but most of it’s a long way from kosher.@xan_desanctis This is one thing I disagree with you strongly about. I’ve never really cared for any of the citrus skittles. Apple isn’t as good as grape or strawberry, but it’s a clear step up from lime.Really interesting thread on World War I battlefields and what’s become of them. https://t.co/dKjtg2bk2H“But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.”
Psalms 52:8 ESV@neontaster Don’t we already know it’s going to be Dunkelzahn?@SethAMandel I go to a lot of Christian concerts. You‘ll probably hear the Gospel presented from the stage, but politics, almost never. But I do live in the Bible Belt. It does make me wonder: is there a Jewish equivalent to “Christian Rock”? That seems like it’d be a fun show to go to.You're basically a prince with better hair @tc0pe. 
https://t.co/76qfskpHef@PhilWillSays have I told you how much I like your Congressman? Could use a few like him over this way. https://t.co/sgzyhC5zps@Thomasismyuncle I thought the scene just before this with Odin was really good. “Are you Thor, the god of hammers” was one of my favorite lines in the movie.@TwainIAint Politicians don’t draft these things themselves. I should know.@jpodhoretz I liked it at the time.  In my defense, I was 11.@TwainIAint FWIW, I was expecting him to be named Rapper Laureate, or possibly Secretary of a new Cabinet-level Department of Music or something.@TwainIAint Don’t give him ideas!Conclusion: Prince William is going to name his new son Kanye. https://t.co/t7nv4N575n@senatorshoshana How slow were you if you couldn’t catch a sloth? 😂@JRehling @greg_doucette *per day.  800x365.@Farragop @charlescwcooke @clairlemon I suspect he knows more about the UK in general, and those reporting on its civil liberties issues specifically, than you do.@RAVerBruggen Did they hack her Twitter too? Plenty of tweets still up accusing people like Rush Limbaugh and Lindsey Graham of being in the closet.@MollyTibbs Not a “shout in”?@NCbonfires @senatorshoshana What’s a “Qperative”?I read today that someone “writes like a thesaurus gained sentience” and couldn’t help but think of @TwainIAint.
