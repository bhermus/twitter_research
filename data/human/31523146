Maybe it gets shorter as the seasons go on...@fernantraters - I’m really enjoying ER but can’t handle the theme song. Both length and music haha. #So90’sFirst night using a weighted blanket.

#TheSwaddleEffect@steph_swi https://t.co/prOGQz5obPThe pillow fort/blanket fort war episode of Community is definitely in my top 5 episodes. It’s hard to choose a top 5 actually.

It’s honestly probably better than seeing it in theaters, am I right??I love that ER takes place in Chicago. I 💙 that city!@fernantraters Yeah I only got through one episode before I fell asleep but I was thinking the same thing. He is good with the kids though so that’s something 🤷🏻‍♀️And you can tell the snow is fake when it doesn’t melt from people’s hair!Watching ER on Hulu. Never seen an episode of this show before.
