Now it makes sense lol https://t.co/hjGm6hzBLVI'm deadass feeling Nicki on a spiritual level today. There is nothing worse than feeling like you've been played or people are coming for you and no one believes you fml " Bitch ain’t comin’ off the bench" #NickiDayIt takes two people to have beef with each other. You must have poultry or something cause I'm chillin 🤔Apparently when you treat people the same way they treat you, they get fuckin’ offended. 😒@ereshkigaI @princesslucxfer @TATIANNANOW He said something about Tyra working at Amazon and how he's talking shit but needs to package Tati's shit properly. Some shady shit a long those lines. All I can think is "You're jealous, no one who's that happy puts others down blablabla"Those people that preach about being nice and a good person all over social media but are some of the meanest, evil and ill spirited people you know zz Just remember while you're faking it online, there are people that actually know you in real life #cuntDEEEEEEEEEAAAAAD https://t.co/lUUlMXNcVk@shaayy_lo @MannyMua733 @KylieJenner Sis do you have a Youtube channel? So dope! That green is sickening!!!!!Look after yourself! Be brave enough to be alone. You got this uce xI guess what we should all try to do is to be a Hermione to our friends. Cause this getting convinced you're alone shit is not cute at all.And if you think about it, Voldermort is evil, I imagine him with no love, just hate and darkness, and I can' t think of a better way to describe this feeling.@jk_rowling Maybe I'm late but is Harry Potter basically about battling anxiety and depression? In TOOTP Hermione says something to Harry along the lines of "He wants you to think you're alone, you have to fight it" and idk but that's what it feels like suffering from the above.YA'LL!!!! @alissa_ashleyy is so close to 1mil!

Many of your "friends" are only concerned when it's benefiting or affecting them. The ones who really got you 💯 are always concerned; your well-being matters to them.Stay away from negative people. They have a problem for every situation.Bruhhhh bring on holidays!

The apology I need to accept is the apology I'll never get 😊I know I'll never get the apology I deserve from you, cause you think you've done nothing wrong. I can't force and won't beg for one.@OMAILEI YAAASSS PAE! Did it on em! wooooo! Hope you're good tho lol x@patrickstarrr @NikkieTutorials @heyitspeterrr_
