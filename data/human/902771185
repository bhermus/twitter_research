Also in CR there is no such thing as waking up later than 8am. That is actually waking up late. Everyone wakes up at 6am. You know me I go to sleep late and wake up late, so getting here and waking up early, yeah that’s a big dealI hope I take this sleeping schedule back to the U.S with me. I’ve been waking up at 8am sharp everyday... EVERYDAY PEOPLE. 
Y’all know I’m not a morning person.The more I come to Costa Rica the more I realize what family means.
