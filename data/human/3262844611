I adore the movie as well, probably one of the best TV to film adaptations of all timeI could watch The Simpsons everyday and not get tired of it. The characters are so well realized and fun plus each storyline has something anyone could gravitate to. The newer seasons may not be as good as the classic era but I still do enjoy watching them.@KrennZack  https://t.co/xS7XAOLDGx@KrennZack I think this guy would beg to differ https://t.co/XDtjXvvPlLMy ★★★★★ review of Avengers: Infinity War on @letterboxd: https://t.co/KyMfSXyXEU@KrennZack  https://t.co/43j4o9QlxnMy ★★★★★ review of Captain America: Civil War on @letterboxd: https://t.co/jfZUv6Qo1QHonestly I do not think I have been this excited for a movie since Star Wars: The Force AwakensMe because Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters this week!!!! https://t.co/t94PyeZ4WuMy ★★★★ review of Blockers on @letterboxd: https://t.co/LtUkf0R9ze#filmstruck4 part 4 https://t.co/QyV5UizR0h#FilmStruck4 part 3 https://t.co/I0wTDsBsX6#filmstruck4 part 2 https://t.co/1o9Ro4cTHy#filmstruck4 Part 1 https://t.co/gP54cgpbVAMy ★★★★ review of Avengers: Age of Ultron on @letterboxd: https://t.co/O46ccuGGGEMy ★★★★★ review of Guardians of the Galaxy on @letterboxd: https://t.co/VXdPIk8Dc2Also Avengers: Age of UltronMy ★★★★★ review of The Avengers on @letterboxd: https://t.co/GgbJTV4h6vBeen pretty busy lately so I do not have time to review the MCU movies I haven’t review yet leading up to Infinity War but there are at least three MCU films that I feel I must review before Infinity War and those films are The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy and CA: Civil WarMy ★★★★½ review of Isle of Dogs on @letterboxd: https://t.co/zWLgdoLtgIMy ★★★★ review of Rampage on @letterboxd: https://t.co/dLmKL2DtjhMy ★★★½ review of Chappaquiddick on @letterboxd: https://t.co/IK2FZL6kbE@KrennZack Already saw Pacific Rim, I’m seeing Rampage no matter what haters say and Blockers I might see but Isle of Dogs is a must, I’ll see it after I see A Quiet Place@KrennZack Ugh I wanna see that so bad. Still hadn’t opened in Memphis yet. It supposedly goes wide next weekend so I’ll see it after I see Rampage (IK IK, it’s been an anticipated movie of mine for personal reasons) and A Quiet Place. Currently on the band trip@KrennZack Maybe a comeback for Mr. Sandler@KrennZack I get it. I guess I am just easy to please when it comes to big budget effects and movies starring The Rock@KrennZack Oh yeah that’s right Adam Wingard attended full sail. But that already had it bad because it was an anime adaptation and we all know how those go. Rampage at least knows what it is and has fun with its premise, at least that’s what it looks like from the trailers@KrennZack How does this not look awesome https://t.co/vMZncf5atK@KrennZack C’mon, at least have some hope for it with a Harding alum attached to it@KrennZack The Rock touches nothing but gold unless it’s called Baywatch. The movies he does are all well done for what they are trying to be like the Fast and Furious films, San Andreas and Jumanji which was one of the biggest surprises of last year@KrennZack There’s no way it will be the worst movie of the year. There are plenty of films that look far worse and a few blockbusters that have already been awful (cough cough, A Wrinkle In Time) https://t.co/8myuvbxp0u@KrennZack Woah woah hold up.....why u hating on Rampage!!!!!! It’s got The Rock in it and not just him but my guy Jason Liles who was a Harding alum is playing George the gorilla in the film. For those two alone Rampage is high up there for meThis weekend I’ll be in Orlando so my review of A Quiet Place will have to wait until next week. First and for most though I am seeing Rampage next weekend before any other movie but then I will defiantly try and check out A Quiet PlaceMy ★★★★★ review of Ready Player One on @letterboxd: https://t.co/BGZPrCob3SMy ★★★½ review of Paul, Apostle of Christ on @letterboxd: https://t.co/Of9iRYo3QyMy ★★★ review of Pacific Rim: Uprising on @letterboxd: https://t.co/hs0IOhggW7@bestavenger2001 2010: Inception, 2011: Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2, 2012: The Avengers, 2013: Lone Survivor, 2014: Whiplash, 2015: Star Wars: The Force Awakens, 2016: La La Land, 2017: Logan, 2018 (So Far): Black PantherMy ★★★½ review of I Can Only Imagine on @letterboxd: https://t.co/WqIC4hk5UMMy ★★★½ review of Tomb Raider on @letterboxd: https://t.co/gYQTyaoap4CAN THIS MOVIE JUST COME OUT ALEADY!!!!!!Marvel Studios' Avengers: Infinity War - Official Trailer https://t.co/awCMGy34qq via @YouTubeMy ★★ review of The Strangers: Prey at Night on @letterboxd: https://t.co/Em9ZbS0wY3I might be the only person who liked  Gringo. There was just something about it I really dug, it felt different than anything I had seen in the dark comedy genre. It is not a perfect film, it has a lot of subplots and is a bit slow at times but I found the film surprisingly funMy ★★★ review of Death Wish on @letterboxd: https://t.co/TONwTce2lCMy ★★★½ review of Gringo on @letterboxd: https://t.co/Qq8RN0522EMy ★★★★½ review of Iron Man on @letterboxd: https://t.co/qdmqcrc0MTAlso look forward to my reviews of Gringo and Death Wish later todayMy series of Marvel Cinematic Universe review leading up to Avengers: Infinity War begins todayMy ★ review of A Wrinkle in Time on @letterboxd: https://t.co/Vw8dLFtFAfLove that Rampage is getting bumped up a week, the film deserves a good box office runThere is no film quite like The Shape of Water, it told such an incredibly authentic story that felt real despite it being a fairy tale. Congratulations to everyone involved #OscsrsWhat a legendary figure Frances McDormand is. Her performance in Three Billboards was remarkable in ever sense, such a well deserved winGary Oldman gave a truly career defining performance, he completely captured Winston Churchill in every way possible. He is without a doubt one of our generations best actors #OscarsGuillermo Del Toro is such a talent, cannot believe this his first win. If he deserves an Oscar for any film, it is hands down The Shape of WaterAs much as I loved This is Me, that song from Coco was incredible. Glad to see it win #OscarsThe Shape of Water had a gorgeous score, no shock that it won #OscarsFinally the greatest cinematography in film history gets the recognition he deserves, congratulations Rodger Deakins, you’re a true legend #OscarsThis is my favorite win of the night. Jordan Peele wrote one of the best written thrillers in the last few years. Glad to see Get Out get some love #OscarsBlade Runner was one of the most visually impressive films I’ve ever seen. Beyond happy it won #OscarsThere was no other animated film this year than Coco, congrats to everyone involved #OscarsWell never in my wildest dreams did I think Kobe Bryant would be an academy award winner #OscarsI really need to see I, Tonya. I’m sure Allison Janey is truly amazing in it #OscarsAnything made by Del Toro is honestly a guaranteed lock for Best Production Design. Good job to The Shape of Water #OscarsLooks like Dunkirk is two for two, maybe it’ll be the next Fury RoadEvery minutes of that 90th Anniversary montage gave me chills #OscarsGlad to see such a great underrated talent like Same Rockwell get some award recognition #OscarsOscar predictions part 2 https://t.co/1kOM1B7NSfHere are my predictions for the Oscars https://t.co/SyLVC9pl6fDuring spring break i plan on seeing and reviewing the films A Wrinkle In Time, Gringo, The Hurricane Heist, Thoroughbreds, Tomb Raider and I Can Only ImagineYes, in a weekend in which the new releases consist of Red Sparrow and Death Wish, I saw Peter Rabbit. But I do plan on seeing both films hopefully during Spring BreakMy ★★½ review of Peter Rabbit on @letterboxd: https://t.co/YzVU89lwRaWhen you see the news that Avengers: Infinity War is coming out one week early!!!!!!! https://t.co/2ieXndgr38My ★★★★½ review of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri on @letterboxd: https://t.co/AymJ40989mMy ★★★★ review of Game Night on @letterboxd: https://t.co/Vyu0YbgMNv@KrennZack It’s my #1 of 2017 without question. It had a huge impact on me, I’ll never forget watching it in the theater for the first time@KrennZack That’s a near crime sir@KrennZack  https://t.co/uQUuqzOQbsMy ★★★ review of Early Man on @letterboxd: https://t.co/QG2SCiTjG8@KrennZack That’s the Teen Titans movie that should happen rather than what will be the Emoji Movie of this year, Teen Titans Go: To The MoviesBlack Panther is an absolute triumph not just within the superhero genre but within blockbuster filmmaking itself. There are so many great layers to this film from the compelling character arcs to the riveting and sometimes even shocking storytelling. Ryan Coogler is a master. A+Me during and after Black Panther https://t.co/Tw6JDiXEtaMy ★★★★★ review of Black Panther on @letterboxd: https://t.co/TNei6Gmoh3Look forward to my review of Black Panther Thursday night. Also possible review for Early Man and Samson sometime during the four day weekendMy ★★ review of The 15:17 to Paris on @letterboxd: https://t.co/0LRx8OuCaP@KrennZack To be quite honest I think it will win nearly everything it is nominated for, in my opinion it is already a lock to win Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Production Design. Logan, The Disaster Artist The Big Sick are the films that should have had more nominations@KrennZack I will say I think Blade Runner got all the nominations it deserved. Don’t get me wrong, I would have loved to have seen it be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director or even Best Screenplay. The Screenplay is the only thing I really think got snubbed from that movieMy ★★★★ review of 12 Strong on @letterboxd: https://t.co/PdBZnpIxXrMy ★★★★ review of Phantom Thread on @letterboxd: https://t.co/hfqP8YzChgMy ★★★★ review of The Post on @letterboxd: https://t.co/l8ul7hUUkSMy ★★★ review of The Commuter on @letterboxd: https://t.co/8tPlEhye0JCurrently Watching https://t.co/kDd07fREQeWell all I can say is I guess I need to see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri #GoldenGlobes2018My ★★★½ review of All the Money in the World on @letterboxd: https://t.co/tzSFJrMJEDCurrently working on a tribute video of my favorite movies of 2017My ★★★★★ review of The Shape of Water on @letterboxd: https://t.co/XZ2AEq1BQA@IonBarbuEremia @KrennZack Except Kingdom of The Crystal SkullMe right now because it’s Christmas Eve https://t.co/LqK5sBdVDzMy ★★ review of Bright on @letterboxd: https://t.co/vcFCeEB2ncMy ★★★★½ review of Darkest Hour on @letterboxd: https://t.co/anzBkZAs40My ★★★★ review of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle on @letterboxd: https://t.co/8f6u5e0FnNMy ★★★ review of The Greatest Showman on @letterboxd: https://t.co/VCeajN3Ri0@PAKA_FLOCKA Darkest Hour, Molly’s Game and The Shape of Water. Also I’m going to watch and review Bright on Friday sometimeGot a lot of movies to see before the year is up. I’ll have a review of The Greatest Showman out tomorrow and a review of Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle out Thursday night. Other movies I will try to see and review before the year is up are Downsizing, All The Money in The WorldIs it my favorite movie of the year, I’m not sure. I’ll have to think long and hard about which film I like better, The Last Jedi or Logan.After seeing The Last Jedi a third time I stand by my opinion that it is an absolutely perfect Star Wars movie. It takes so many risks that pay off immensely plus it has possibly the best action sequences in the entire series. I would go see this three more times in the theaterMy ½★ review of Daddy's Home 2 on @letterboxd: https://t.co/wcfJKkq1kp@J_Cagle2438 And I don’t understand why people are saying that. The film does non of those things@J_Cagle2438 That it goes against everything that was set up in The Force Awakens and that it completely changes old and new charactersThis is an absolute travesty!!!! I am baffled by these reactions, there is even a petition demanding that the film be rescripted. What is wrong with people!!!! https://t.co/3IcgNUxCVoDear Academy, Please just go ahead and mail Mark Hamill his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor https://t.co/FWvopXb04IHere’s a sense of how I was reacting to The Last Jedi in the theater https://t.co/uzjJwk3g0pStar Wars: The Last Jedi=PerfectMy ★★★★★ review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi on @letterboxd: https://t.co/ksKksSGkaNCurrently sitting in the middle seat on the top row of the biggest Auditorium at my local theater waiting for a little movie called Star Wars: The Last Jedi to start!!!!!

If you loved Stranger Things Season 1 you’ll love Season 2 as well (say for Episode 7). Grade: AEverything they want from the amazing characters to the great nostalgia of the 80s and the ending is one of the most satisfying endings.....Stranger Things Season 2 Thoughts: Despite one absolutely horrific episode I absolutely adored every minute of this season. It gave fans....Whoever came up with the idea for Episode 7 of Stranger Things Season 2 should be banned from the TV industryMy ★★★½ review of Jigsaw on @letterboxd: https://t.co/fsOznqYPu0Look forward to my review of Jigsaw tonight (my nearest theater isn’t showing Suburbicon so I’ll see that when time is more convenient)My ★★★★★ review of Only the Brave on @letterboxd: https://t.co/ZgKOUpxvk5My ★★ review of Geostorm on @letterboxd: https://t.co/kd2QAlvXPJ@AlannaBennett Also James Franco for Best Actor@AlannaBennett Best Screenplay (adapted or original), Blade Runner 2049, Dunkirk and Thor: Ragnorok for visual effects@AlannaBennett For Best Supporting Actor, Sally Hawkins For best Actress (haven’t seen Shape of Water yet either), Get Out and The Disaster Artist for@AlannaBennett For Best Actor, Gary Oldman for Best Actor (even though I haven’t seen Darkest Hour yet), Bill Skarsgard, Harrison Ford and Patrick Stewart@AlannaBennett Blade Runner 2049, Dunkirk and Logan for Best Picture.
