I love  @tomwaits so much. He's the only artist that can make me cry when I'm feeling happy. It kills me that he never tours.The first time I ever saw @melissamccarthy was on Bridesmaids. That perfect, funny movie. I've started watching #gilmoregirls for the first time and seeing her as sweet, perky Suki is blowing my mind.#Legion  is just so deliciously fucked up. It's The Prisoner for this generation.also, getting drunk and watching Kimmy Schmidt. mostly for Tina Fey but also because the red head is hot AND funny.I am absolutely scared shitless by dolls that are bigger than a Barbie doll. Those dolls that look like actual, real dead babies? Paralyzed by fear.i have so many thoughts.@thisisdanbell I totally agree! And that screw in pony tail he had!

Action movies are favoured, as are quirky comedies and indie stuff.I can't believe that there's a tube strike because some idiot who clearly couldn't do his job was given a new job instead of being fired. #tfl employees need to get their priorities in order. #districtline #underground #london #TubeStrikeDeep down inside aren't we all Pickle Rick?

I just found out that there is a Jake Ryan out there that's real and plays sports ball. I bet his parents did it after watching Sixteen Candles.Also,, #JakeRyan is now fifty-fucking-seven years old. I googled him. He's aged well enough but man, some things are better left in 1984. 
#SixteenCandles.@GillianJacobs is 110% believable in #Love on #netflix . I literally forget that I'm watching a show when Mickey gets... the way Mickey is. It's so awesome when you found out someone is actually a good actor.Jake Ryan is the only guy on the planet who coukd make a sweater vest sexy. #jakeryanIts raining so hard in #London  a woman just walked past my house wearing a yellow plastic shower cap.@thisisdanbell

It's like #BroadCity only depressing and one of them got knocked up and Rosie O'Donnell is her very unsupportive  Mother.I miss the neo-hippies of the 90's with their dolphin tattoos, birkenstocks, thinking they invented hummus. Oh those were the days.When I was 24 my body could withstand 3 day binges. Now I can't sneak a fart without peeing a little. 
Middle age sucks nuts.No one makes phone calls anymore. My 16 year old's phone started ringing.  It was her friend calling and she panicked.  She wasnt sure what to do. 
Seriously.@thisisdanbell  Hey. So we're trying to find one of the older Dead Mall vids with all the 80s mall commercials.

Please send help.Is it weird that this video turns me on a bit? https://t.co/LrBulumQIh via @YouTube@thisisdanbell Have you ever been to the Canadian side of Niagra? It's so tacky it's almost depressing."sexless fart party"
#BroadCity@gikkt Yep. another woman treated me like an employee! maybe its just London.While I love the idea of #BorrowMyDoggy we only ever get people looking for free dog day care.

The first season of #PushingDaisies arrived today. Just in time for Pi Day! #PieHole #PecanPie@iPunchBabyz With you, it's different.I am so, sooooo fed up with those GD stupid photo filters.
