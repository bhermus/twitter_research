Society needs to have more of these meaningful interactions! Again not tryna argue, not competing for who's right and who's wrong. Just nice to hear some insightful thoughts!@aileenyulissa Okay I understand that you may think that because of the person that we change into but there is research out there that states direct affects from an adolescence age leading into your grown years.@aileenyulissa But if I were to argue this everyone has a different perception on right/wrong, wouldn't you say? And if someone was conditioned from a young age to think like this what else can we do other then teach them to think in another perspective....@aileenyulissa I agree! I'm not arguing, just stating a different perspective on the same subject.It's not the men's fault that this system is conditioning them to treat women lower though.... #thingstothinkabout https://t.co/OBfzqsxlkC@kiimmmye Omg your so sweet!!!!
