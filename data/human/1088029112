Is a milkshake still a milkshake without ice-cream? Need to settle a debate so answer honestly@Mr_Cyclone_Man The hardest dick to cover upWe did an exercise at uni yesterday called “Cover that Dick”
One person draws a dick and another person has to cover it up and make it into something else. See if you can spot all 15 dicks.
A fun game for everyone to get the creative juices flowing. https://t.co/y81pHjcTgq@AKindAleWar Hipster HitlerThere’s a kid sitting next to me watching a Pokemon/Three Days Grace AMV and more than anything else I’m just glad to see that the AMV medium is still alive and well.On the plus side, I’m still working on stuff, still need to do the full animation but this is mostly simulation work. There’s so much processing that I might kill myself before my CPU does. https://t.co/EKmFibDKtq@BIGDAMOOO Daddy pleaseSo I’ve been away for a while, I’ve had stuff going on like moving places and not having internet for foreseeable future. Tell me, do people still laugh on Fortnite servers?@BIGDAMOOO This is divine punishment@sodap0ps UnacceptableUpdate: I caught it and put it outside, took 2 tries but I can sleep easy
Good job teamI don't want to spray it because it's right above a bunch of my bags, also because Huntsmen are just nice guys trying to do their own thing so I'm at a stalemateCame back from a shower, didn't notice him at first but the fucker's bigger than my hand and right above my door, I can now never leave, nor can I sleep https://t.co/aTUnMSdhd8In Australia, it's common practice to drink Vegemite to test it's qualityA classic https://t.co/ciOJ6k4dr9Playing PUBG with the boys, get in here kiddos

@SHUFFY_YT @sodap0psI need to be invited out somewhere
I bought a two packets of jelly for jelly shots before realising I had no reason to make jelly shots.
I mean I could just make normal jelly but where's the fun in that?@sodap0ps Headshots only@sodap0ps Fight me@sodap0ps I've been sitting here trying to think of a witty retort but I just really like this design over my other one among other reasons@sodap0ps Have you tried turning it off and on again?In short, could’ve been worse, I found myself kind of enjoying it and I give it a solid 5/10 because honestly, I’m just glad we got something that’s somewhat entertaining if not a little fuckedLike I wouldn’t label it a hot mess of a movie like some. It had a couple of good moments but the biggest issue was pacing and exposition. It was just too fast paced and left out details or skimmed over things it shouldn’t haveSo I just finished the Fullmetal Alchemist live action movie and it was... okay? Serviceable? It wasn’t great, it wasn’t terrible. It was better than I expected but not as bad as I thought it was going to be20 minutes into the Fullmetal Alchemist live action movie and it's actually already trash.
It's not a good adaptation but it's not even good on it's own merits.@osu_voltron @djthedork I'm sorry for the spoilers as well@osu_voltron You're welcome https://t.co/8kQC4DPyR6You have my erection https://t.co/a3o7tOm2g8So i've had this issue lately where it doesn't feel like I'm creating stuff that's as good as I'm capable of.
I have the knowledge on how to do things but once I start a project, I just can't finish it fully and I'm gonna try to stop doing thatKeep in mind when I scheduled these tweets on Christmas that it was 4 in the afternoon so I was already fucked by this pointThe dude was 100% a fucking freak though, like he deserves to be on that listAlso found out that one of the people I've known since primary school is now on the Australian Sex Offenders list and honestly, while not surprised, it's caught me a bit off guard at how soon and whyI just kinda closed my eyes and BOOM
Next day, seamlessly and I'd be lying if I said it hadn't been tripping me out all dayI fell asleep yesterday at 3pm just from being super tired, woke up and it was 10:30 but the sun was up.
Took me 2 hours to realise that I'd slept for about 16-18 hoursI’ll get back to full scale projects soon, I’m just really busy at the moment, for the moment it’ll mostly be fillerI'm gonna need you to sign this NDA

@BIGDAMOOO Watch as we play through We Were Here Too and exercise our expert communication skills.
@WeWereHereGame@ChildishJesse No@The_Azalan Now that you’ve pointed it out, the resemblance is uncannyStarting conversations or doing small talk is one of my biggest weaknesses, so if I try, I implore you to bear with it.
Same with if you try to start a conversation with me, talking isn't my best aspectI can't wait to regret this whole thing tomorrow@waffleNG 
See
This is slander
Why did I make this?
I should die@waffleNG If you like soy than there is no slander.
Full milk or no milk
Only REAL people like ACTUAL milk@waffleNG Fucking soy boy, what?
You like soy or some shit?
Soy boy
lmfao@CJ4000live I'm sure you'll kill it!@StevenSuptic This is now my ringtoneHow many of those I wrote is now put into question.
I don't remember that one and how far ahead I wrote things is a mysteryJesus Christ
Fucking chill dudeGod is dead and we killed him
-Yet another scheduled tweet from drunk Dah on ChristmasSo I finally did a video after a year in case you missed it, which you shouldn’t have. https://t.co/D2BljDD2P9@AKindAleWar How long did it take you to clean that hot mess?I still don't know how this game worksWoah there buddy, do you suck at CSGO?
Well fuck me sideways, let me teach you with this 100% shit guide!
https://t.co/6gtVBl23a5Or if it wasn’t too fucking hot to focusI’d probably get a lot more work done if I wasn’t so irritatingly lazyIf you ever feel like you've done a bad thing, feel comforted that you've never walked into a pancake parlour with a large group, all looked at the menu and walked back out because everything was too expensiveRemember when I made videos? That was cool@iamqueALT @AKindAleWar Actually in hindsight that would be grand, I haven't eaten in days. I'll take that if that's all tops? Cheers mate@iamqueALT @AKindAleWar and can I get the few bucks for helping teach you Photoshop tricks and how to actually use a camera?
A dollar will do, just need money for a chupa chub@BIGDAMOOO HaWent to look up "Do you have to pay tax on Bitcoin?" and these are the suggestions I got
No I don't know de wae and yes, I will google it later https://t.co/09goloIYAmIt'd be coming along a lot quicker if I wasn't so lazy about it but it's making progress TuTI also got more of this done, still need to do the payphone and the scenery but today's progress was the street lamp https://t.co/rDPwlfXW1uI am working on it though, that's a big goal for this year is to both learn how to start conversations and to stop double thinking everything I'm about to say.There's a lot of people I've met in the last 4-5 months that I've really wanted to talk to more but my biggest drawback is being shit at conversation and not knowing how to keep one going.
So, it's not that I don't want to talk to people, I just don't know how to words words@Skorqion I aim to pleaseI'm gonna become a Five Nights at Freddy's Youtuber
Gonna make a killingI'm gonna get one and only tattoo
One of Pinocchio. right above my cock so that every time I get a boner, his nose gets longerI'm just gonna bump this because I'm really happy with it https://t.co/oFbHUZkg9IIn other news, I spent half my day doing the textures for this and I still have to model the payphone https://t.co/p37J9Kyixb@MzzaArt @Phoenixgg2 I didn't see that change, this is just everything I have access to at the momentTo clear up confusion, I lost the ability to monetise early last year when they implemented the 10k total view rule, this is a list of everything you have access to if you don't meet requirements https://t.co/1cLQhbmlGt@BIGDAMOOO Gotta get that 45 cents of revenue boi-oIf you're creating content, it shouldn't be for money or revenue when you're starting a channel, it should be because you want to create and make videos, money's a good side reward but for a video that doesn't meet the new requirements, not worth advertiser moneyLets be real.
The people complaining about the new requirements for monetisation are mostly the same people who were getting a few cents per video from MCNs anyway.
They're very reasonable requirements and a really good move for giving more ad revenue to the people who deserve it@IHE_OFFICIAL it's a good way of weeding out the people that only want to do Youtube for the money instead of for the love of making videos.
Gives genuine people who like making videos a better chance at getting ahead.Literally my only goal for today was the wake up at a decent time.
It’s now about 2:30pm and I only just got conscious enough to move.@TheFearRaiser  https://t.co/4Y6InMxSUXI bet the creators of meme chat weren't expecting Uganda Knuckles.
Which is fair enough, because neither were we@BIGDAMOOO At least three@ZACHxFULLER I was finding random hair in my food all the time. Good luck to you my dude, hopefully you can find a better way than I of keeping hair out of your goddamn face@ZACHxFULLER Mine was February last year, trust me, it gets in your face, distracts you while driving, makes you look like an emo.
It's terrible@OfficialPubcast I'm more a fan of UFC
Uncle Fucking Contraption@BIGDAMOOO Cum tissues, floating jizz strands, you name it, it's probably floating up there and if there is life on other planets, it may be from space splooge.I just needed to share that because I can't hold the responsibility of holding information like that, there's too many other questions I have about itSo I learnt tonight that astronauts do wank in space and that the way they handle it is by catching their splooge in a large tissue and throwing it out of the shuttle.
So keep that in mind the next time you watch one of those "This is how water behaves in space" videosWhat a time to be alive
https://t.co/rilTWuVAK6@GiggukAZ Not on Netflix Australia yet.
Doing proper releases has never been their forte.There was something I used to do when I was learning how to write.
I would pick a word or subject and just write the first thing that came to my head.
I think I'm gonna start doing that daily again, just something short every day to get back into the flow of creating storiesTomorrow I'm gonna stream literally just so I can do something.
I don't know what I'll be working on but I'll figure it out as I goI feel like not enough animated movies or shows, mainly big budget ones, don't take enough advantage of the medium, the power in animation is dynamics and the ability to exaggerate.and if I have the time, trying to focus more on animation as well instead of stills, get more dynamic movement and character animationThis year I have only a few goals, most for the work I put out.
I need to work on set dressing, lighting, I wanna get better with modelling and texturing, specifically painterly and stylised textures and overall, just improve the quality of backgrounds@BrandyButt_ It’s like “hey man we get it, you have a big dick, no need to shove in my face”
Just give me a guy with an unnoticeable tiny cock and we’ll have a good movie. The only exception is Harrison Ford, because his characters are meant to be ballsy@Portal_God @AzmoLIVE See? Lets give the people what they want
Unadulterated drunk Australian bullshitWho wants to be on SmarTheDah podcast?
I'll be talking to myself for most of the time but you're welcome to join in@AzmoLIVE @Portal_God Not on SmarTheDah, on my show my vote carries the most and on a 2 to 1 scale, I win@Portal_God @AzmoLIVE It's a 2 to 1 vote, the motion carries@AzmoLIVE Okay but allow me to offer a suggestion, we change the name from AzmoCast to SmarTheDah and it's 70 minutes of me@AzmoLIVE So the answer is yes, let me steal the lime light@AzmoLIVE I would steal the show and you know it@AzmoLIVE You're tired and disillusion, it tastes more like Fantabut not a very good one, kinda like an Australian that forgot what it sounds like to be an AustralianI want to be on a podcast
I have a lot to offer
like a personality
and an Australian accent@AzmoLIVE You Americans are weird@AzmoLIVE Is that not something you have in America?There's an irony in the fact that neither me or my mum want to add eachother on facebook cause we don't wanna see what eachother is doing.
However, I just post memes and now I'm curious what kind of second level meme lord life she's livingI just picked up my tripood and my entire desk fell over, my desktop, my monitors and everything that was on it fell
and I still can't figure out what the fuck happened.I can't enjoy films as much as I could before I learnt how to be a film maker
It's all "Wow, the cinematography's a bit off isn't it?"
or "wow, his dick's a bit big for this part, should've cast someone with more of a chode"
Just takes the mystery out of itI was trying to look up the story of the Racist Tree but instead came across this gem of an article https://t.co/bIg8HqRR0tHyojin may be the easiest one I model because I don't have to model a beer mug or a triceratops but rather a normal person with fennec earsWhich isn't a bad thing, it just means I don't have to texture one of themAm I basicallly assume the whole pubcast to be a 1920s, looney tune style caricature to model my entire project around?
Cause I have no issues with this
but one will be black@BIGDAMOOO Well I'm already 2 hours past midnight and I'm aready fucked so my New Years revolution is to not be hungoverDid I really make it?
Is this my sign?
Did @squizxy really follow me finally?
Do I finally get a reference for her character so I can make Pubcast animated? https://t.co/MHrVvAcuul@BIGDAMOOO Wee-woo
No nudity pls
This is a Christian theatre
No swearing please https://t.co/asmwotyD4z@BIGDAMOOO NO! Rating R should not exist, it's offensive and terrible
I would like to be kept at G/PG rating at all time
No sex ever@rooting_around @Lord_Bung Will you give me a smooch when I come to NSW?Thank you to the @EmojiMovie for helping me figure out how to make a glass with a face on it
Surely that was the thing I needed to be answered by a cash inI thought putting a face on a piece of fucking glass would be hard, and it was for nearly 3 years, but I did it in an afternoon while live streaming and it made me look like a fucking git when I found it easy@Lord_Bung @squizxy Fair call, I'll use this one cause I like stylisation but if in the future, I'll update it accordingly@Lord_Bung @squizxy Is there one that you use more instead or is this the main one?Hey @Lord_Bung and @squizxy 
Do you have references for your OC/Persona?
I'm not stopping at Aidan and I need to do the full gang for it to feel proper@Lord_Bung NY 2015 - Getting drunk for the first time and vomiting on their porch
NY 2016 - seeing fireworks at the beach
NY 2017 - Staying at home playing Destiny 2 wondering why I payed $55 to Activision in the first place@AKindAleWar @DolanDark I think it's a big ask expecting you to upload twice a yearAlso for anyone interested, I camped the entire time during my PUBG match and came 26thHow drunk was I on Christmas that I don't even remember scheduling those?
Jesus Christ
I mean I have a point but fuckWhen the fuck did I schedule those?@Portal_God Spoiler alert it’s shitWe talk a lot about the Spiderman/Elsa videos and how disturbing they are
But does anyone stop to think
"In 5-10 years, are there going to be kids that remember them fondly as good childhood memories?"
Because that's the real scary thing to me.
Just remember that for 2018Happy New Years! I'm not at the phone right now because I'm fucking wasted but enjoy this tweet that I scheduled on Christmas!PUBG literally crashed as I was match making
It doesn't want me to get that chicken dinner or a good new yearI'm gonna play PUBG and by the time I die, it should be the new year
Kicking it off the right wayAt least then I have a god damn excuseI can't wait to see what I waste my money on while drunk tonight
Last time it was Destiny 2
Tonight I hope I drunkenly buy a whole new fucking mic setup@lambo_clabon It's every month from when you pay
Basically, answer number 2Here's my advice for working in a liquor store on NYE
Don't
Go get fuck eyed with friends
The money isn't worth it@KatieKuma I ID'd a bunch of people for lots of booze
#GrogShopOnNYE@KappaKaiju I mean, we've all been there right?@ReinaScully Didn't we say the same thing to 2017 last year?@KappaKaiju I'm getting drunk and watching my old videos because of an ego problem.
So not quite as fun honestly.
I need some backstory though, how did they get locked in there?@BrandyButt_ While you’re at it, get some more beer@BrandyButt_ Just go watch a movie or something and by the time that's done, it'll be finished.
May I suggest "Guess Who's Back" on Netflix?@BrandyButt_ Have you tried turning it off and on again?@AKindAleWar Kept being told no legs
You got it
So no more legs https://t.co/stKyX3LvK5It's a work in progress but finally getting around to creating a proper @AKindAleWar rig and model.
There was a strong debate about whether to give him legs. https://t.co/wjfPuZShaNGonna be streaming some design and asset creation so that I can actually get some work done!
https://t.co/KwgMFoAFu4

Come hang out for a bit to keep me company@KEEMSTAR For the police to have understood that I was naked in public because I was in a strip mall and I thought it rude not to be.When I know I'm getting close to dying, I intend to bury all my remaining money somewhere and turn it into a One Piece style scavenger hunt and yes, it will be open to everyone.
Hope you enjoy looking for a disappointing, buried $10 note and a picture of me naked.@Portal_God Not the thing I enjoy the most
Getting high takes that spot
Either way, I'm super, super out of itI am actually so fucked
I've been drinking since midday but since I started taking shots is when I really got fucked
Merry Christmas@KatieKuma @MzzaArt I started out with half a bottle of Southern Comfort, a full bottle of infused Vodka and 7 bottles of cider
You'll be alright fam@KatieKuma @MzzaArt I have atleast half a bottle and despite how much of it I've drunk today, I'm still doing alright
Get on itI'm an alcoholic but sober me will never admit it
Please screen cap and use it against me later@KatieKuma @MzzaArt May I suggest buying a bunch of lollies and infusing it with vodka?
Merry Christmas!Also I scheduled some tweets for New Years but I don't know what they are so enjoy thatMy typical tasks for understanding how drunk I am are 3 fold
1: tweeting how drunk I am
2: Talking to people more than I normally would
and 3: if I tweet a lot
Specifically the third one are a really good sign if I'm fucked beyond repair@MzzaArt @KEEMSTAR I'm way beyond tipsy, but that's why now is the best time to catch me for imformation@MzzaArt @KEEMSTAR You're making it seem way less important, which I don't appreciate
I have some very serious matters to discuss with Mr. Keem@MzzaArt @KEEMSTAR Yeah no, I realised a bit too late
but I really do have something@MzzaArt @KEEMSTAR So am I, so it's all goodHey @KEEMSTAR 
If I can, I wanna talk to you about something that's going on!
DM me if you wanna hear it@JetTheFurry @MzzaArt I'd rather be high than drunk
First time I got high, I stared at a wall for 20 minutes wondering what it was trying to say to me, while laughing the entire time before calming down and wondering what we had to eatI finally learnt what 'yeet" means
Am i super late to the party of what?
Do you young kids stilll use that word?@JetTheFurry @MzzaArt Actually I didn't read the second half
I'd rather get fucking baked@JetTheFurry @MzzaArt I'm also Duct and the cheese is an necessity of or tradition@MzzaArt @JetTheFurry Have you ever seen a selfie or picture of me? I'm so white I reflect light@KatieKuma My answer before midday
but here I am at 1am, completely beyond fucked@MzzaArt @JetTheFurry Do you want me to buy it for you or myself?
It is pumpkin spice after all
