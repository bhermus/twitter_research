I'm a Bengali American (you're probably too dumb to no that country) and I make fun of myself@lucidsabrina obviously your pc ass won't get it so I think we're about done@lucidsabrina and are you a poc? I don't think so. These "racist" jokes aren't one way. There are brown jokes, Asian jokes, and white jokes@lucidsabrina oh please people like you don't deserve to dragged. It's just funny seeing you fail@lucidsabrina ...Gay jokes, racist jokes and say all kinds of shit to each other all the time. In the end we love each other and that's that@lucidsabrina Listen bitch if you're so offended by their friendship, stop watching and go suck a dick. My friends and I make fat jokes...@lucidsabrina Real/best friends make fun of each other harmlessly. Fake/weak Friends are always polite.@lucidsabrina sure she'll get offended, but if she was really bothered, she would say something or even stop being friends with Riley.@BackstreetGem ... friend who you love is not promoting the culture. Farkle loves Maya, and would never do anything to hurt her.@BackstreetGem Honey I don't know where you've been but that doesn't promote rape culture. A surprise example of affection to your best...@lucidsabrina ... to make fun of your friends jokingly. If she really meant what she said than she wouldn't be friends with  Maya at all.@lucidsabrina A verbal jab or two does not equal a toxic relationship. Strong friendships thrive from the people being open and able to...New tool to know who visits your Twitter profile https://t.co/xG6wLdEL61 https://t.co/CScaLsvlCe@GMWWriters when you have a big Minkus in the photo but not a little Minkus. smh@GMWWriters WE ARE FAMILYLast Visits: @Andreagarfias04 @discreetsab y @AwardsForGrande. Discover your visit: https://t.co/sYdHay4jOlWhy would you ever cancel #GirlMeetsWorld ? It's the best show on Disney, and the numbers show that! #DontCancelGirlMeetsWorld 🌎@Hxrrystylinsonx cool cool. I ship Joshaya, but only ship Lucaya in fanfics. I'm more of a Rucas girl, but Riarkle is da bomb@Hxrrystylinsonx oh whatcha ship?@hartnblake she don't look disgusted https://t.co/2qqxZRWloB@Hxrrystylinsonx oh sorry you just seemed like a pissed off Lucaya shipper@GMWWriters he looks... the same https://t.co/fzrK2nEjm3@Hxrrystylinsonx don't get butthurt cause your ship didn't happen@hartnblake she's happy waiting for Josh :)@Andreagarfias04 @discreetsab @AwardsForGrande do y'all mind? I'm not even in this convo but you still using my Twitter handle.@osaxox I can see why you would believe that considering both Lucaya and Jesus are fictional things... (No offense to your beliefs@CynthiaLouise3 you can't ignore that Maya said she didn't like him. So sad to see another member of the MDE fandom not get that@CynthiaLouise3 listen I love Lucaya. I love writing fanfics about them, and I still ship it... in fanfics.@GMWWriters ugh only 21 episodes :(@voguesabrinas oh sorry Hun. No harm meant. Never wanted to trigger you or hurt you 😞@voguesabrinas Anyway Hun maybe you should go back to you're real life instead of trying to win an argument you lost from the beginning. bye@voguesabrinas the fact that you think he'll go back to Maya after choosing Riley is unhealthy. And sorry if you're to blinded to see thatDon't you just hated when bitches think they the shit, but really they just are petty and crave drama@voguesabrinas and um m who do you ship? Lucaya? The most unhealthy relationship on the show?@voguesabrinas facts are facts. They won't be having sex, but if they were it's legal@voguesabrinas https://t.co/SYzX6Hs9gj@voguesabrinas it's not though@voguesabrinas umm does it matter if it's a play. GMW is a show@lovelyIucaya hey don't have to necessarily have sex. Relationships are more than that@voguesabrinas also I don't know of the word play with my username was intentional but well played@voguesabrinas Romeo and Juliet happened a long time ago. Plus Josh and Maya don't have that much against them like a raging family feud@RaquelKozume also https://t.co/cVk7Qttrj1@RaquelKozume @discreetsab they are waiting. Why doesn't any one get that?@iiProudChu you seem pretty chill even though you told me to fucking grow up😂@yslbrina "I'm in it for the long game." She chose to wait. And when you wait that long for someone you obviously care a ton@iiProudChu yeah but that doesn't matter since he lives in Cali but was born in Nevada@yslbrina I mean they are waiting@eIizasqueen people are saying they're being sarcastic. Like why would the writers the literal creators of the characters say they are wrong@Fatima_Irfan09 Honey you can't choose one girl, but then go crawling back to another. That is not a healthy relationshipHUH I GUESS THREE YEARS DOESN'T REALLY MATTEE AT ALL https://t.co/4ESG4Wx0Et@eIizasqueen yeah even if Lucas made the "wrong" decisions that doesn't mean he'll go crawling back to Maya@ultrahart um dumb bitch, I'm talking about after Maya's 18. Besides Josh is waiting till then. Plus consent age is 17 in New York so....@carpenteas How can I respect crazy shippers who are sending death threats to Michael, want to kill Riley, and are stopping watching GMW@carpenteas Maybe because you and the rest of crazy Lucaya shippers are like yelling and ranting at the writers?@discreetsab Oh my god, three years! Yeahhh... outside of K through 12  that doesn't matter. Why don't you fucking grow up?@carpenteas actually I don't fucking care. I like Lucaya just not the crazy bitches who ship them@carpenteas I mean I'd rather eat pussy, but definitely not your hairy cunt.@yslbrina Oh don't cry, baby. Want to wipe your tears on my sweatshirt?@AwardsForGrande Yeah and no one asked for you're opinion, so stop trying to make a dead ship happen@yslbrina Well no one asked you to say Maya likes Lucas when she clearly doesn't. I guess you can't expect much from a Rolf fan...@AwardsForGrande I don't think you do@cabellosflex dead things don't come back to life@yslbrina welp Actually I think not 'cause she said she didn't and she's in the long game with Josh so.....@GMWWriters oh Lordy what you planning@peytonmeyer9 My favorite thing about GMW is when Lucas tries so hard to being funny that he actually becomes funny because he's that bad😂#growingupwithglasses when a little pool of grease forms where you're nose and frames meet😁@GMWWriters so what you're saying was the show you watch from the audience involves ship wars and constantly prying for answers?@GMWWriters so deep and insightful@HillaryClinton thank you for praying when @SenSanders is too focused on GMOs@GMWWriters #worldmeetsgirl  why do you let half of the fandom hate Riley?@GMWWriters #WorldMeetsGirl  will Katy be more of a hands on mother after the Maya identity crisis?#worldmeetsgirl @GMWWriters 
S1: friendship
S2: growth
S3: feelings 
What can we expect in Season 4?#worldmeetsgirl @GMWWriters  Farkle said he couldn't pick between the girls meaning past tense. Now does he have one he loves more?#worldmeetsgirl @GMWWriters  will Katy be more of a hands on mother after the Maya identity crisis?#worldmeetsgirl @GMWWriters  Maya said she's in it for the long game with Josh.
