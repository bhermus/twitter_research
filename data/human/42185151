Big, Strong, and was nice with the releases. Pete loves big WRs too. I believe he will have a good shot at making the 53 at the end of training camp. https://t.co/yTpmi8Av8O@ShumpertTony @TFordFSP Real facts Shump!! 🙌🏾When I see a grown man crying while speaking in front of an organization that he started, it moves me to tears. So many say what they are going to do, while some just do. These kids are our future. Nobody is perfect, but the heart of @TFordFSP is right here. https://t.co/op5sc56M6mThis right here is REAL GAME! https://t.co/0P4p6AHQot@MkVictor11 @LincolnVic5 @TFordFSP @gofordsports 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾#Seahawks #RookieCamp2018 #Day3 https://t.co/r5mwHhdcHj🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/7vBUa1NlcO@D_Tardy7 🐐@Twizzle31 🐐@morgantlindberg @Seahawks He’s on great shape, has nice size, and is healthy.

Tre Flowers can play. He’s big, strong, fast, and stands out even if you didn’t know who he was. Oh, and McGough the QB out of FIU was good again. Folks, he might be a Diamond in the rough. #RookieCampRumble young man Rumble ✊🏾 https://t.co/j6QybnkcsmFind out when @pennyhendrixx started playing football for the first time. #DrivingWithGee #Seahawks

I see it everyday. Some folks are outraged and care about something because that’s what the crowd is doing. Those that follow a crowd can never be followed by a crowd.@davidbcastillo @AuctioneerGee Same here my man. 🙏🏾Hey Centralia, I’m on my way down there. Y’all kinda like my second home. Let’s have a blast tonight. @AuctioneerGee #AuctioneerLifeIt was really great to meet you Josh. https://t.co/Y6GgjzHxMq@CoachCross2 @Seahawks Man!! 😢This is why that no matter what, win or lose, this organizations changes lives. I’ve seen it first hand. #Seahawks... and then it happened 🤷🏾‍♂️7-on-7 drill huh. It’s weird how much I see that term used these days. Some will tell you that nobody pays attention to it. #Weird 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/P3pNHcm799This is a perfect example of hard work. Players I talked to at UW say he’s one of the hardest workers out they saw over the years. https://t.co/S5fU9GPY1vLooking forward to having @ImMollyBloom on the show next week. I love her story. #KiroNightsThis is the first time I’ve said this. I really think that Shaquem belongs here in Seattle. To have the chance to play for the man that coached up KJ and Bobby, both on and off the field, it would be the ultimate. Ken Norton Jr. is that deal!@RealNyonza I feel him. Trust me I do, but you can never win this battle NO MATTER WHATBless his heart.. https://t.co/OghbuoZL4EDown goes @okcthunder..

*Then something happens*The greatest relationship between player and fan is the day they get drafted. So much love for during that time...@AndrewRBlack1 Glad you saw that. 😢“The Seahawks RB’s could never get in the end zone last season.” 

*Same Person* 

“I can’t believe the Seahawks took this guy Penny in the 1st. Round.” 

Seahawks: https://t.co/BkQcJhxw8e@chancetherapper Nah, YOU IN IT!!When some see this video, they will say, “What did he do? He must have done something to deserve that. I need to wait for more facts on this.” https://t.co/zxCkdEz23D@Kschmidt67 @AlexRozierK5 @KING5Seattle @jwhittenbergK5 @JoyceTaylorKING @CamJohnsonK5 @SteveBunin He’s making a great point!!@JubalFlagg .@JubalFlagg, MY GUY!! 🔥🔥🔥He Tweets about Kanye, but not about James Shaw Jr. Wow!@BR_DougFarrar Nah, @BR_DougFarrar is solid as they come.
