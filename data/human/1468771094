        Silence

Really doesn’t tell a person what you’re thinking...

Why don’t people just say what they mean?   

It will hurt either way, but I like the Band-Aide method. Rather than the slow torture...

The End@steveolivas Do zombies sweat? I thought they oozed ☺️😵😂 Yes, this is my daughter’s lasting marks on me. Never would have started watching #TWD without her.@mrblue_101 Exactly! What a waste not to live. Met a stranger just yesterday while chatting to coworkers on the employee bus. He laughed at our girly conversation...turned into adventures. He shook my hand, introduced himself at our departure, and stated we must continue this conversation :)Tears of joy    ...one day
HopefullyAfter a while, when words stop meaning anything, trust follows. Words are just words without the meaning of their action. Just promises left on the ground to die. He’s a smart man, why couldn’t he see that? 

The heartbreak of having to let go follows, for self preservation.@sfn_eddie @FerretSqueaks @AwardsDarwin @oberbaum7 Car driver obviously stopped to see if that was their exit, no technical issues but the brain. Should never have had a license, if they even did. A truck cannot stop on a dime, especially while traveling on *expressway 60-70mph! I hope they were found &amp; prosecutes for the death.Have to choose? 😭 https://t.co/aTZnGhKHCA@random_atheist @JoyceCarolOates Who was arguing geographical location of The University of Colorado?

They weren’t outside, they were in a building. Amazes me that people come in a long thread &amp; know everything.

No one here in Twitterland really knows anything.

It was ALL subjective opinions, and it’s done.@welycha @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates You need to read the whole thread. This has already been commented on several times! Dispatcher asked... 

No one knows what is in another’s mind or heart. No one here in Twitterland knows first hand. It’s all just subjective opinions.@CSisto66 and did you ⬇️ https://t.co/UnI38bLIpF*and *you *need *to *read
*the *whole *thread 🤪 https://t.co/vsvAVrkGgt@Maui_Speaks Wait a....
    You mean to tell me *gasp
we exist?
     This isn’t just a box of letters making up words?@LadyOfTheMists Back atcha 🥂 xx@LadyOfTheMists Enjoy sweet lady! 💫@springday0317 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates And...had read the full length of this thread you would see that I’ve replied several times to this statement.@JMDziba @JoyceCarolOates Sorry it took so long to respond, I’m one of those privileged white people who had to work today at 6am.@JMDziba @JoyceCarolOates How many stupid blonde white women have you seen arrested for terrorism? But it has happened. There are bad people in all shapes, color, genders... and there are firsts for everything. She stated she thought Hispanic after being **asked** by *dispatcher. *Context!@fannypackbitch @JoyceCarolOates Still opinion@TheMominatrixx @JoyceCarolOates Guess you’re one of those privileged white families who’s never been asked questions, told to take items off, or been searched. Mine has not fallen into that 50’s world Lucy. Conditions arise that cause circumstances one has to deal with &amp; these young men did exceptionally well.I think I just heard his audible sigh. I wonder if it was out of sadness or relief.@unStunned @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates Was at work earlier &amp; phone was blowing up. Sorry for irritated, terse reply. Not supposed to use phone at work 😉@BOYCOTT_ISRAEL4 You’ve proved the reason for why this woman was nervous. Constantly seeing/hearing these reports, then a chain of events that makes someone wonder if this could happen again. Unfortunate environment we all live in. Should have been handled better.@miltongeorgem I still have my communicator (flip phone) from Star Trek, stuffed in a drawer somewhere :)@Namaste2525 @quailcrown @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates The question is was she being racist. Taken out of context anything can be made to sound different than what it actually is. She did not mention color, nor ethnicity until asked by dispatcher. So...Ugh...No.@IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates Yes some are, unfortunately, but she did not mention color or what she thought was ethnicity until asked. That’s not being racist, that’s answering a question.@medlando007 Ah, those wonderful bank holidays :) Hope the weather holds out!@Downeygirl2 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates I have no agenda.@IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates She was answering the question from dispatcher! Are they white? Start at the beginning, before phone disconnected! 🙄 Not racist.@medlando007 Finally nice in the U.K. 
Surrey is beautiful!
Was there last summer.
Visited Debbie’s winery a couple times🥂@IowaPeg @Downeygirl2 @JoyceCarolOates I think you both need to take a chill pill, especially you @IowaPeg You may have a heart attack going like this all day! I’ve been to work and back, and you’re still going about this. And Jean, just be nice ‘sweetheart’.@templestark @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates What did I lie about Stark?

Funny how this isn’t about me, but people are making it &amp; some very personal like bringing my son into it.@Downeygirl2 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates Ya know, I take people as individuals not as their nationality, color, or for something a family member(s) has done... I would have never married my husband if I did. It’s all on them &amp; how they treat me. The old adage “treat others as you would like to be treated” does work.@creolelady53 @JoyceCarolOates That’s wear 🙄 And no kidding genius.@Downeygirl2 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates You’re pathetic!@quailcrown @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates READ the first paragraph in report. Before the dispatcher starts asking questions🙄 
I’m done, this is like a dog chasing it’s tail.@unStunned @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates Yes, and god forbid anyone have a different opinion than you?!?@TomGSW Actually, she just called it an “oversized sweatshirt” on original call. The University stated that it was a hoodie.@bullfish777 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates Scary that people wouldn’t know! Hard to follow when no one is liking the other’s conversation, so understandable :) x

Sorry if I snapped, just tired of being called privileged just because white &amp; racist too. Isn’t that racist or at least stereotyping?@IowaPeg @bullfish777 @JoyceCarolOates You read! Top of the page on link you sent me. Obvs don’t follow own advise “dude”. I also *listened to her call. Gaaaw...I have to be up in a half hour for work, so done with you!@bullfish777 @IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates I’ve already addressed that one, but no one reads my comments obviously.

Its all just a shame &amp; very sad that this even happens in this day and age.@IowaPeg @lilyforest51 @JoyceCarolOates She called them two young men. Top of your page 1st sentence. It was not until she was *questioned color that she said Hispanic... 

You aren’t *reading her original call. Jumping to conclusions &amp; taking out of context. Those are answers to questions asked, not racist remarks.@IowaPeg @Dginki @JoyceCarolOates Yes &amp; she never mentioned color. She was being asked questions later. If you were asked what color I am will you lie? She was answering questions, it was not her statement she made when calling in. Think about that. This is how people twist truths idiot. It makes a better “story”@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates The 30k deaths are what prompted this woman to call. She called it an oversized sweat shirt his hand was concealed in. This began as fear that something was going to happen. Plain and simple. It’s a sad world that anyone has to think they may not be safe, especially at a school!@IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates She called them young men. No color mentioned, until people started reporting on it.@IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates She never said that. Listen to her call instead of believing what some reporter is feeding you. Gees!@IowaPeg @Dginki @JoyceCarolOates Where is this “news” story from? You can hear the young men in video say New Mexico.Sounds like the “news” wanting to make more out story than truth perhaps. Watch video of young men! Everyone was polite, and went on their way.@IowaPeg @JoyceCarolOates I have no idea why she handled it the way she did. Other than thinking one may have something in his sweatshirt. Not a racist act is all I said. No color was mentioned by her. And it’s New Mexico that they’re from, not Mexico. One’s a state in U.S., the other a different country.@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates And now they have vans plowing people over. Canada just had 10 people killed, 14 injured, what was it last week? When I was in greater London last summer there were constant stabbings, acid attacks, and a van attack. There was just a shooting May 1st in London area, so?@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates Thought you may need to reread to comprehend another person’s point of view. I’m off to bed. In to work by 5am@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates Of course ‘sunshine’. Why I said that explains it🧐 Also why I left teaching, closed minds. By the way I’m not Republican *gasp! Problem is, it won’t make our children safe. Drugs are illegal, but people still get their hands on them. It’s called illegal activity for a reason.@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates So all the Presidents children &amp; families are protected by armed guards, people in prisons are overseen by armed guards to protect their ‘community’, but our children are not worthy of protection by  trained, RESPONSIBLE individuals? Ah, “teacher” in University explains it!@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates Obviously you have not lived my life to call me privileged. You have no idea what I’ve been thru.m, and it obvious that anything I say will not change your point of view, so waste of my breath as usual.@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates I was in a teacher position at an elementary school for a few years. Was also in the service. With trained, responsible personnel it would have saved lives in Parkland. The cop on duty sure was useless!@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates And shootings can’t happen at Universities? Huh, history seems to disagree. The hands inside the hoodie and face concealed are what is of concern. I work at an airport, with armed officers at times. Depending on threat. Guess I could take that “It’s very obvious...” as racist eh?@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates And if you watch the videos, they were fine with being questioned. Just as anyone who has nothing to hide should be. Complacency is why these mass shootings continue to happen. If the guy in Parkland FL had been dealt with there wouldn’t have been that shooting. Context!@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates How ignorant can you be? It has nothing to do with color. I am white &amp; am asked to take off sunglasses at work when entering certain areas. I couldn’t wear a hoodie covering my face or have hands in pockets. It’s called safety. People have been asked to pay attention &amp; report...@Prufrockery @JoyceCarolOates And if it were something bad, everyone would have been saying “Why didn’t anyone call”. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t! That’s all I’m saying. Better safe than sorry with all the happenings, as she put it, going on. I’m stopped all the time at work &amp; asked for ID.@JoyceCarolOates It is sad &amp; sad world, but...If you’d listen to recordings instead of jump to conclusions, she said she felt ridiculous but after all of what’s been happening at schools...
They slid in late. One had a hoodie on and hands in the front pocket the whole time. Not racist. Context!Silence is fine when ‘the one’ is sat beside, walking next to, or spooning you from behind with a soft breath on neck, falling deep...
It’s when they’re across an ocean that the silence hurts.
It feels like loneliness, as if you’ve been abandoned and are lost.
