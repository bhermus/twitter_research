No. It's propaganda, what did you think they would do other than keep the propagandists in power. The most abusive will ingrain into a child's mind all the better.Criticism devolves to hate when it is not carefully thought out to be helpful in order to grow or correct an idea.Why don't the girl scouts broaden their range of activities? Why does every male group need to be infiltrated and taken down?

The ladder has a point, the former will bring you down.I once told my Ethnic studies professor that the younger generations don't think in terms of race and it's going to die off as soon as older gens die. 90% of the room was with me and turned against the professor.

The network you work for and others as such are propaganda arms for a two-party dichotomy of ideology and Ill-thought out statements like this furthers polarization.

You have to speak in layman's terms otherwise you just stroke your own nutsack, not helping anyone to understand anything.@DJ_2112 Ie; Philosophy and Science are a methodology. It doesn't matter what the conclusions are. It's dogmatic to cling to conclusions. The methodology is what produces that which is most accurate given available data, if that doesn't stand you can't call it Philosophy or Science.The truth is in the methodology not at the conclusions.Collectivism is essentially an argument for Utilitarianism. 

Who decides the greater good? 

Hitler once decided he had a "greater" "good". It's bullshit.@kanyewest Close friends until death, even though they disagreed on fundamental philosophical underpinnings.

MARXISM 101@briantylercohen This behavior is why progress is so stagnant in society. People lash out emotionally and tribe up against those they disagree with instead of coming together in win-win negotiations. It's reprehensible, intellectual cowardice and furthers polarization to ultimate violence.This behavior is why progress is so stagnant in society.

OF COURSE the categories we use are inventions but that does not change the observed patterns in the world that can be mapped onto different categories. @jordanbpeterson I would love to see you debate this guy.Credit creates debt, and debt especially Government debt sells and enslaves the unborn so we can prosper in the now to arrogantly let future generations figure it out or collapse. https://t.co/PSwEL80kwH@Cernovich  https://t.co/cOZBDwzdKlhttps://t.co/oAaSvQQt2x We should bring back the concept of dueling@kanyewest A TRULY free society #TaxationIsThefthttps://t.co/5WskydghKrDon't forgive yourself for things that you have not solved. #WednesdayWisdomThere're different levels of analysis. You might see talk about "dragons" and think it's stupid because you project a non-understanding of "dragons". Dragons have deep-seated symbolic meaning in history, cross-culturally.
