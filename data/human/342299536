I need to speak to somebody please and not go through the same 8 calls. #shockingGood luck @Laura_Chisnall in your 3rd interview this.  Hopefully this one will secure your teaching position for September and next year after yesterday’s appointment #teachers@Laura_Chisnall We’ve tried our best Laura.  Rest is up to you and Alex now.

Thanks.@virginmedia 45 minutes on the phone to a lady called MonaLisa.   She finally sorted out the issue.  I now have an engineer coming out on Thursday to upgrade BB and TV.@SkyUK Cheers@SkyUK I’ll give them one last chance and if not happy then I’ll be in touch.  Upto @virginmedia to pull their fingers out now.@virginmedia I will when I get home from my morning meetings.  Seriously considering sky especially as I’m paying £135 every month for not a lot of anything in terms of support.@virginmedia Wireless connection. It’s shockingly bad and costing a fortune on 4g connectivity. I was told by one of your colleagues that it’s being upgraded and that was 6 weeks ago.   It’s even worse now with 20MBPS on download and even worse on upload.I don’t think so. It’s not that fast!!!! https://t.co/iWIAUd61ILWell! @virginmedia please be prepared for another phone call tomorrow from another cheesed off customer of 20+ years.  20 MBPs #crapbroadbandPolice helicopter out over Castleton after a red car has been dumped at the bottom of onslow st.just finished a Runtastic run of 5.11 mi in 46m 19s with the #Runtastic PRO app: https://t.co/nqXd6F8Mb6@LFARefs @FA @BFWREFEREES @BuryReferees @WiganReferees @PrestonReferees @leighreferees @LMRefs @LancashireFA @Accringtonrefs Congratulations everybody. #refereesWorld autism day tomorrow.  https://t.co/aPyjfHNmLM@oswyinca Starting tonight Jim.@SteveKuncewicz You’re a trained ninja.
