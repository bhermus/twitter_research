We had some snow falling yesterday...My dream is for all people of all cultures to be more open and understanding of each other, we have so much to learn from everyone. #DreamStillLives https://t.co/5Ziv5NBcJJJ'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "[GOT7 STUDIO] GOT7 "Thank You(고마워)" Live" à l'adresse https://t.co/SkzbDhq0AW.@AronK935 It is beautiful but so big...@Egle0702  https://t.co/w7yIh13dV6@Egle0702 I knew about the formality of 감사하다 but not the rest. This is why I need a study partner, so I can understand the little differences and be able to move forward with my learning. Thank you very much for the small lesson. :)@Egle0702 Oh then I was wrong. I thought 감사합니다 was used to thank people in general and 고맙습니다 was used to thank ppl and expressed that you are touched at the same time. That’s what I interpreted from the different videos I saw. Which is sino-korean?@Egle0702 No worries, take your time. Know that what you do is greatly appreciated here and I don’t mind the tardiness as I don’t come often either. Except for today apparently. Took me forever to understand the diff between 고맙습니다 and 감사합니다  but I got there eventually.@Egle0702 I wish I could go to S.Korea for a few months to learn but I have way too many responsibilities here to allow that. I don’t come on Twitter much lately but when I do, your translations often help grasp the parts I could not by myself. Thanks a lot for that. :)@Egle0702 Ah so just like that t-shirt then! I have it at home. I call it my Khun shirt since the character kinda looks like him. 😂 but thank you! How did you learn korean? https://t.co/xf6Wjg2I73@Egle0702 Why does Hamtaro look mad at me? I don’t speak hamster. 😂@Egle0702 Never said I open it often though. 😳 I should though. My goal is to be able to watch a drama without needing the subtitles one day.@Egle0702 I feel like I should open the textbooks more often but since I am most of the time out of my house the applications are handy. Each has its own ups and downs, I need to take a little in every source to complete my understanding. Though I have one of the textbooks here at work. https://t.co/OgXYHnLGu2@Egle0702 감사합니다 애글레씨 😊🙏🏻@Egle0702 But for the restaurant, I mostly go with Dee but we’ve both been short on cash in the past months so we haven’t gone to the restaurant opting for home-cooked meals instead. 저는 한글은 아라요.  Not sure of I wrote this correctly though...@Egle0702 I study mostly with memrise, duolingo and LingoDeer while I am in the bus and I have a few textbooks as well. I do own an English-Korean dictionary, a verbs book, an image dictionary (mostly for my kids though they never pick it up) and even bought flash cards for them.@Egle0702 I do dissociate the most I can, but this particular sound is confusing. I even refuse to read romanized Korean as it confuses me even more. Then again, I have no one to practice with so I cannot gauge if my prononciation is ok. Except when I go at a restaurant that is.@Egle0702 Being Canadian French, the 으 sounds to me between our “eu” and “ou”. It all depends on the speaker what I hear and it’s confusing at times.@Egle0702 Ah, so you mean the difference between 오 and 어 or 애 and 에 for JB right? I never paid attention but I guess you are right. And for RM, he is one I understand more easily than others. At least the few words I know...@Egle0702 I agree. Though somehow I would be more attentive to RM’s tracks since his deeper voice is more soothing to me. Love JB to bits though, been a fan sinc JJP after all.@Egle0702 I never buy audio textbooks as concentrating on sounds alone often puts me to sleep. But if such a book existed, I would make the effort to learn.When you have push notifications but are not in a wifi zone to check what’s going on... 😅 https://t.co/y1zRg4d4P4When a Canadian winter just won’t end.

I prefer the feel of Boyfriend. I can picture a 1940s mafia bar with fedora hats.@I_EmmaGhost @retropedia I love Angel and Good man too. Not sure I know Farewell trip though. Which album is it from?@BTS_twt Haha I love the parental advisory, though it clashes with the pastel colours 😂@Egle0702 This Run BTS episode was hilarious. Which makes me think, I still haven’t watched last week’s... but not tonight.@elise0917 Our groundhog has seen it’s shadow so spring in 6 weeks tops (or so they say). My favorite season is autumn but 2017 provided us with about two weeks of it. It sucked big time. Barely any colour on the trees and we had snow.@elise0917 Oh so that is the difference! They are beautiful but daffodils are better, imho. I miss flowers. Go away snow! 눈이 빨리 가!@elise0917 I noticed this morning when I used their Practice mode, it uses Romanization once in a while while it is disabled for the normal mode. It irked me. I might switch to using the keyboard too, it is an excellent idea!@elise0917 That’s nice to know, thank you! I ended up using this app for an hour straight yesterday haha@elise0917 Was able to download it after a restart. Skipped the alphabet, breezed through Nationality, now on the 3rd chapter. Wish the voice would not slow down everything when you choose your answer. My son will like this though. I’ll install it on his older phone if it’s compatible.@elise0917 Found it! Now if my stupid phone can finally download it... I have to restart everytime I want to download a new app lately. Argh.@elise0917 Duo is better than memrise, I’ll have to see if LingoDeer is available on the Canadian AppStore...@elise0917 I feel you. Can’t seem to learn Korean properly either. I study with DuoLingo 20 to 30 minutes everyday, I recognize more words but alas...@elise0917 My kids’ father is 6’3” and a half (or something) and our 2nd daughter currently stands at 14 at nearly 5’11”. But yeah, 9” difference with the last guy I dated was such a huge difference in height...@elise0917 We were Twitter-introduced by Dee, who is a good real-life friend of mine and speaks French fluently. You probably did not grow up in NorCal if you studied French for so long?@elise0917 Woah. Last guy I dated was 6’5” and I felt like a dwarf with my 5’8”. I’d barely reach the guy’s nipples if I met your 7’ plus guy. Lol@elise0917 Oui, je parle français, merci. (No worries, I have two keyboards on my phone, normal and korean so I can tupe in three languages haha. And French is my mother tongue, btw)@elise0917 It’s okay, I love learning about the different words and I don’t mind being corrected when I don’t use the correct one. Though my mom was the expert in plants. I barely keep my indoor plants alive. 😂@elise0917 I might have been lost in translation. Those are called “jonquilles” in French, and wordreference said it’s either jonquils or daffodils in English. I am sorry.@elise0917 Beautiful flowers. Jonquils right? This is my current view... https://t.co/x7PB20cSL8@elise0917 Enjoy while it lasts. We had snow again yesterday and it’s pretty gray outside right now...Just because he’s an amazing human being overall.
