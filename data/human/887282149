I'll buy all the seasons and we can binge watch with food and wine!Chase after the dream don't chase after the money...then please do NOT ever put them on. That's why they make creams and polishes to fix the marks you make when you WEAR them. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️They are meant to bend and break and flex and move with your foot. If you expect them to look like they do on the shelf...Dear people who think your boots will ALWAYS look brand new and perfect.....give me a break 😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️All you people complaining about the flu need to stay FAR FAR away from me!
