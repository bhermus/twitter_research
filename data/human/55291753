He's about to be a furdadBut man, don't think he's ready for Bitty lmaoI'm so hyped to move into this apartment. 👐👐👐Up, creeping on someone I dont know, when I should be asleep.I now notice my series of tweets took forever to post and now they are out of order.Literally couldn't breatheI'd like to be happy and healthy, ya know ?The struggle...So I went to the gym with Andrew today, and Jesus Christ I'm out of shapeBut I'm going to stick it out. I'm down for body acceptance- but if you're not happy in the skin you're in, change that shit.But.... I also want to eat my fair weight in chicken wings...I really hate small talk, and that's probably why I have 3 friends.Memories and new beginnings - ☺ this pup is freaking adorableAnd although I love him already, I miss my dog. Forever missing Finster 💗Guys, I got a new puppy last week. His name is ShadowI just want my bed thoughBUT I have Friday off for a wedding and that means it's a short week for meeeeeeeDon't want to go to work 😥Mind you since I cut most of it off, it takes 15-20 min maxI have to straighten my hair and I really am not trying to.I'm hyped, so now I want one lmaoOne of his gifts is an adult sized hooded towel. Batman themed of courseI bought Andrew a bunch of stuff for his birthday on MondayI can have 4 hours of sleep if I go to sleep right now. ☝I'm a really bad texter.😐However, all the band's were great today. And bless the gods that none of the band's we wanted to see overlapped times. 👐.... And I'm over here looking like Amanda's gonna call me into the court room with the other dancing lobster..Infants out there living a good, sunburn free life....You telling me- after applying 100 SPF sunblock to my skin four times today, I got this burnt ??Infant sunblock is only 80 SPFIt was SPF  100....I put sunblock on four times today and I still look like a lobster.It's warped tour dayyyyyy@Jay_CIH but you make amazing music with a kickass band.... So ya know... Brightside.Butttt we have off Friday for our vacation to start so I'm hypedddddSpending the weekend with Andrew then going home is sad. Miss his face. 😩Interview today 👐Savage lmao https://t.co/pY6meBsfNIWhy does she hate me soThis furrrrrrrball.Update: she wants back in my room, I let her back in and she did it againAndddddd she wants out of my room. She's clearly annoyed with me.I look over, and she stopped cleaning herself to give me a nasty look.So mid-cleaning, she farts.My cat was cleaning herself, right? Do your thing boo. Be clean.@Oscar7472 @OriginalFunko 😪☺  beautiful dayYesssss!!!!!!! https://t.co/JfbGw25rdrI think its worse, because I laughed for 5 minutes after he said itI bought Lantern Festival tickets for Andrew and I in September and when I told him he said, and I quote, " it's gonna be lit, ha! Get it? "Lmaoooo https://t.co/yDVCdQRbsjBeen dying to see @Callithomeny live again 😩 sooooo good.It's an endless cycle, really.And afterwards feeling like a bigger asshole.And I can never seem to put exactly what I want to say into words. At least without sounding like an asshole.And it's the worst thing to explain, and if you do you get the "well, just calm down"My anxiety has been so high lately, drives me insane.I'm still regretting the nap I didn't take yesterdayIt's like that "still got love for a few people I'll never speak to again" type of thing.Life changes, and things happen and people and friendships fade. It's sad but it's true.I used to be close with a decent amount of people, buttttDoubt it. I'm not that interesting and I have like 4 friendsI wonder if anyone creeps on my profile ?.Still feels unreal that he's gone. honestly, feel blessed if you never have to go through losing a family pet. It mentally destroys you.It also sucks because he's in my favorite movie. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."Don't mention Elijah Wood, anything but that guy" and my poor coworker laughed, but had no idea what was going on.I told my supervisor the other day and she cry-laughed when 4 hours later another coworker came over and suggested we watch the Hobbit.I have a deep irrational hate for Elijah Wood.Have faith in the Rockets though 🏀💜☝OKC is coming back like we owed them money.@Oscar7472 DO ITTTTTTTTTTTSame with tattoos. I want more tattoos..... But moneyI want more funko pops.... But moneyBut in reality I just need to go to work and come home.I have to be a functioning member of society tomorrow and that already upsets me.Beer, wings and NBA playoffs. Great Sunday. ☺💜Got an email that my March loot crate won't be here until May 😢@Cas_iee I loveeeeee shameless
