@ryantkelly @ddeitch @mingshan Bausler or hauslerer or huehrer or@mingshan No, but he didn’t bother asking me if I wanted to change mine, so I think we’re good to go.My calves may never recover from whatever dance move I did yesterday that destroyed them.Best card https://t.co/xbUr3VAlMU@latimeriidae @prestonpb More where that came from. By a lot.@resultsboy @mike868y @prestonpb I need to send out a post-event survey so that I can improve my next one.@mike868y @prestonpb Excellent.If I could just sleep for the next 38 hours that would be ideal.@resultsboy @doctahRae Phew@doctahRae @resultsboy Super off brand.

Ask Preston how that goes for him.Took cues from @DahWeasel and has a spicy last minute wedding venue change. Very last minute.

Wondering if he is secretly planning to do Myles tomorrow.@negacoach @B2C2Cycling @prestonpb You can imagine how devastated @resultsboy was to not be defending his win*@doctahRae This seems like a silly thing to apologize for.Shoes ✅

Feel like maybe the usual list doesn’t cover everything for this weekend.@mer__moran I was eyeing fire engine red. I have regrets.@mer__moran I did not get this in time and was convinced to go full bridezilla! https://t.co/Y3hLog2PUD@BostonTomF @BikeNewton @nnchamber @14thVillage @MassBike What were the results?@t_seplavy Turn it around! Learn, grow, always better next time. 💜💜Update: I’m on a 14 lane highway.Why yes I am playing “California Gurls” and The Beach Boys while driving in San Diego. Followed immediately by my life soundtrack, Despacito.@JSANFORD11 @resultsboy @efacc But I am surrounded by odorless palms! (Kiddding, very excited to explore a new place)@resultsboy @JSANFORD11 @efacc Excuse me, but Dover, MA is the Pine Tree State.@resultsboy @JSANFORD11 @efacc Also, the smell of pine trees. And seasons.@resultsboy @JSANFORD11 @efacc @greenfieldcrit@efacc @AdamMyerson How does it end??@efacc @AdamMyerson What happened!?Watching Jurassic Park III on this plane an I am STRESSED OUT.@efacc Wow. That’s horrendous. 1/8!?@efacc Can you explain@steveblack89 @prestonpb @efacc @resultsboy That’s amazing.@resultsboy @prestonpb @efacc Glad I went to a professional conference this AM so that all my new followers could witness this sophisticated conversation.@efacc 🤔🤔@steveblack89 @prestonpb @efacc @resultsboy Oh I get it. There is legit riding. We are bikeless. We have some sneakers for hiking tho.@steveblack89 @prestonpb @efacc @resultsboy Right now you are??THERE IS DUNKIN DONUTS COFFEE ON THIS FLIGHT I AM GOING TO MAKE IT.@steveblack89 @efacc @resultsboy @prestonpb Ermmmmm. Begins with a p. There’s a casino.@efacc @resultsboy San Diego, but not really San Diego because once we get there we have to get in a non pressurized tube and travel at the speed of slow via highway to inland CA. Will be in San Diego on Sunday tho.@resultsboy My point was that California as a state better be worth 6 hours of recycled air and limited stretching ability. Having never been to the state or this side of the country, this risk is HUGE.@caloso89 We’ll see. Will report back.@resultsboy This is a weird criticism.“Estimated flight time is 5 hours and 47 minutes.”

Wow California, you better be worth it@jojochrystall https://t.co/wE0zBPOUnXIt’s go time! #NEbikewalk https://t.co/dJKi0QwfMWI have never been more lost than I just was trying to find the on campus hubway rock at UMass.Spotted: new bike racks being installed near Codman Academy! #dot https://t.co/UMDcyfwIR3Cannot tell you my level of stoke about a six-person, all-woman panel to kick off the NE Bike-Walk Summit with a discussion about the role walking and biking plays in transportation equity. #NEbikewalk@AdamMyerson I am an august baby. It’s not hot until it’s 95+HELLO BOSS YES I FORGOT TO TELL YOU I WILL BE SICK ALL WEEK. https://t.co/hrwhQoCBzFDude - you know where my credit card is https://t.co/R4JBf1JcONYou know Mike Norton is a true hardo because he closes reg at 6AM.Woodstock is an AMAZING race! If you haven’t done it before and are unsure about the trip, it is so worth it! https://t.co/2ZqKD7hZCa@GoFahr @resultsboy You mean you don’t do 130 miles in 4 hrs? In the rain?@GoFahr @resultsboy Ride to Boston and get a Kane’s donut.Also, I can't help but put on my bike brain when I see this figure. People aren't traveling that far on the bus. More bike infra &gt; more options &gt; more job access &gt; more equity. https://t.co/ykfpNgZoiBWow - loving the incredible dive into data for this just-released report by @reconnectROC! Even if you're not a #ROC native, all my fellow transportation nerds should give this a look over. https://t.co/dLU2FixYN2@resultsboy @mike868y Hi I’ve never finished quabbin with “the group”@resultsboy @mike868y You won’t get shelled.@_jenny_wo_ @BosPublicMarket That is a GOOD point.@shopengarten @mike868y It is acceptable. I want AMAZING.@mike868y Ha. Ha.This is so bleak. Someone come make a fortune and open a proper bagel shop downtown. https://t.co/1oCpgCFbMK.@Hubway cannot come to Codman sq soon enough!Paging @HalfBenLiang, you are LATE SIR.@Twon2is7 @KurlyB9 Thanks! Tons of people reached out with awesome ideas. I think we’re good!@KurlyB9 Also we’re only doing flowers as decoration. No bouquet for me.@KurlyB9 I’m really into whatever colors are in season.... and therefore less expensive.@mer__moran Thanks!“Hello yes I’m getting married in two weeks and was wondering if you have any flowers I could have for real cheap”

- an actual conversation I need to have. #ABP@HalfBenLiang @mike868y Who is mike I only know tofupup and Mikey.@HalfBenLiang @mike868y #liangonomics@HalfBenLiang @mike868y Including food stops?@cdehahn Easy fix (once you know about this feature).Anyone else ever have di2 go into crash protection mode without crashing? Not sure if that's what happened to me, but definitely just had to crank it in my 11T for a long time because I couldn't shift up the cassette.@L3gg3s @ryantkelly Just don’t go to Maine.SO excited to see new leadership for this race! just @BikeReg'd for ShopRite Nutmeg State Games Criterium - https://t.co/h6VQvjxXFzDid you know? You can now copy a link direct from the @BikeReg app by clicking and holding the race title! Been waiting for this! Thank you @resultsboy! https://t.co/g76THi7wpxUgh someone tell the race promoter to fix this outdated logo. https://t.co/2iRbNoBkhS@_mattio @alanatwoodars total honesty here, I'm a little terrified to try it. Track banking is terrifying! Looks like 100% off camber all the time. Is that what it feels like?@alanatwoodars wait... I'm probably cat 5 at track. This could be fun!@alanatwoodars I have not! I guess I could take that $600 and buy... another bike!@bradsohner  https://t.co/CAOdsUiIHY@LizLikesBikes @nebranews Sorry I couldn't carry through on this one!What's it like to feel the sun? Can any describe this phenomenon that supposedly exists?@LizLikesBikes @nebranews I've not@LizLikesBikes @nebranews Palmer was a new race that was rescheduled, and also was the day before a much anticipated (but ultimately cancelled) race. IDK. I had to work (yay public meetings!)@LizLikesBikes @nebranews I'm expecting it will shoot up pretty significantly. It's only Monday.@mike868y @efacc @prestonpb @grolby @balbs11 I already said it was almost as devestating as marblehead being cancelled@mike868y @efacc @prestonpb @grolby @balbs11 ok Mr. I went over 4 digits for one second.@grolby @efacc @mike868y @balbs11 seriously this looks like a normal day that you acciedentally racked up &gt;700 TSS on?@resultsboy @mike868y @balbs11 not that I recall....?@efacc @mike868y @balbs11 you wanna LOL at some TSS, check this: https://t.co/nkMqXLocSi@mike868y @balbs11  https://t.co/DhCrTaP9bN@balbs11 @mike868y I've also done 6 gaps. Twice.@resultsboy Is this a transplanted slack joke? Is that allowed? Who do I talk to about this?@mike868y @balbs11 Yes - racing is the other thing I like to do on my bike.@balbs11 @mike868y 6 gaps is actually terrible training dont @ me@negacoach @resultsboy Kermis Friday night, ROC twilight crit saturday night, GVCC Sunday... but that's a metric ton of driving. Not saying I won't do it.@resultsboy I don't want to drive to Maine (obvious reasons) OR do a mountain bike race.Now that I have $600 back in my pocket, I'd like to sponsor literally anyone willing to put on a race the weekend of May 19/20. Kermis Friday, need SOMETHING sat/sun. Plz.I WAS JUST VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE RUNNING RACE. THAT WAS SO COOL.It me.... and I'm at work. https://t.co/AQKUb5mcFr@bensanrides @mike868y @type_iix @HannibalJerkin @resultsboy @iwouldawon I have literally no idea what you are saying.@bensanrides @mike868y @type_iix @HannibalJerkin @resultsboy @iwouldawon This is a ridiculous ask. Nobody plans their entire life around a bike race, not at this level anyway. The only person who makes sure there isn't a conflict on their race date is the promoter.@velocb @resultsboy @3LionsFan @EFTA_1 @kevinorlowski Guys. This is a road race. No fat tires.@resultsboy @velocb @3LionsFan I’m not promoting that race because USAC would find a way to charge us more for insurance.@AdamMyerson Cool.@resultsboy I can see the budget-breaking tee shirts already.Cool. #TroBroLeon https://t.co/RfbpMFd8PRWatching #TroBroLeon, asking myself: “did @resultsboy design this course?”@type_iix Mikey and I were racing to 1000 Watts. He won.@balbs11 @L3gg3s @3LionsFan @mike868y @resultsboy @negacoach @c_quicho Brian ups the shade ante to 🌑🔥🌑🔥🌑🔥🌑🔥🌑🔥@efacc @jojochrystall I would have been burned at some stake.@mingshan 🤣🤣@AdamMyerson @efacc @BrianHaugli @prestonpb Oh that’s pretty good #synergy.She is showering me with compliments and I may start crying. https://t.co/GGtBVoIHQq@efacc @jojochrystall @3LionsFan @mike868y @resultsboy @negacoach Thank you ERIN for jumping in dear god. Rest of @B2C2Cycling I feel your abandonment and it stings.Glad to know I have so many options and that Josette thinks I’m young enough for her team BLESS YOU WOMAN. https://t.co/KUKX7CyBkX@BrianHaugli @efacc was interested in “she’s a brick Hausle” a while ago. I’m more in favor of “lydiciulous.”Raise your hand if your slack channel is analyzing this tweet 🙋🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/w49ZfDgm91@resultsboy @L3gg3s @3LionsFan @mike868y @negacoach I think the shade value registers somewhere around 🌑🌑🌑🌑🌑This is almost as painful as Marblehead being cancelled. https://t.co/2sqA7aRGOl@3LionsFan @mike868y @resultsboy @negacoach Not sure the Lydia brand is in line enough with the glv velo brand. Might actually get rejected.@3LionsFan @mike868y @resultsboy @negacoach That was def the bet“Can’t wait til we both get e-bikes one day” -@prestonpbThe second #citywalkpvd public meeting is about to kick off! Talking about phase 1 designs (Clifford street, Pine st, &amp; friendship st) and kicking off the design for Broad Street! https://t.co/pOG7MJh2aEThis is really sweet and I want to say despite the unfortunate race cancellation, I’m really appreciative of the support so many people have shown. Mike - keep those entry dollars and continue putting on great events without someone begging you to do so. That’s my wish. https://t.co/PwXk2BVz6fLove @bikesnotbombs getting people stoked on bikes. Ran into a safety session today. Beautiful day for a ride. https://t.co/lTKG6xIT57Marblehead lol FML goodbye https://t.co/egcUriqwhQ@efacc 🧟‍♂️😈👹👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼Divorce is imminent. https://t.co/UHZmAQoasi@efacc G-l-u-t-e-n@ULTRAPaully Can’t decide if this tweet totally confirms or invalidates who I thought ran this account.I guess @VP takes his “staying away from women that aren’t his wife” thing VERY seriously. https://t.co/VPlCV4kQuR@bensanrides @resultsboy I have a feeling he didn’t.@bensanrides @resultsboy I wrote a check for $600, sealed it in a lovely card and envelope, and mailed it off in mid January. It was cashed in a timely manner. May or may not have used a Wonder Woman stamp.@resultsboy *

Until next yearMade it to Greek Easter in time. Let the eating begin.Cleaned, but ordered in! https://t.co/h3KDautVfi42 degrees, raining, and wind. Most of the field is in shorts. Apparently all the real hardos are at #sunnykingcritI need to clean the house but I just want to order in soup and snuggle my cats in bed.@L3gg3s @resultsboy I only promote races I can actually try to to decently at.@L3gg3s @resultsboy Have you met me?@L3gg3s @resultsboy Greenfield Stage Race p/b Lydia’s going insane.@L3gg3s @resultsboy It’s not happening this year but is my ultimate plan.@resultsboy So what you’re saying is you’re excited for the Greenfield Road Race?@resultsboy 🔥🔥🔥HEAT WAVEEEEE🔥🔥🔥@resultsboy This is my favorite tweet of the week.@resultsboy Nah, this was prime 7th grade.@resultsboy I don’t use twitter to badger the team. #slackorGTFO@resultsboy Great so people who read my original tweet sill still reg on time!Yooooo Marblehead reg closes on Sunday for reasons that nobody understands but I’m hoping some of you want to come play bikes next weekend. Can almost garuntee better weather. Promise I have no undisclosed reasons for wanting decent reg at this race. https://t.co/Ez7Xe1nzr1IT'S SNOWING GUYS. #readytobundleWowwwwww rejected by the tofupup what has my life come to? https://t.co/FtbaDEy1cq@_mattio I mean - to be fair, they could have probably said whatever they were trying to say in better terms and I would have agreed. But as it was, it read very, very poorly to me.@L3gg3s @GoFahr @WWCGP I swear to all that is good in this world I scheduled my wedding thinking I had properly calculated when this race would be. 😧😢😟This is clearly grossly over simplified, but at the end of the day I always like to revisit a quote that I feel is truly important for anyone working in a community that may not be theirs: “anyone who is experiencing something is more of an expert in it than the the experts.”Further, the stereotype of “bike lanes are white lanes” is not going anywhere if we trade in a community-driven approach for a “we know what’s best, enjoy your new street” approach.But many a project are A. Better because of sometimes long, sometimes frustrating community processes (local example, Allston Interchange project) and B. Liable to fail without a proper effort to talk to the people a project will impact.My better half pressed me on this, so I’ll explain a bit. To me, this tweet mocks a process (admittedly a flawed one) that listens mainly to well-represented (read: white, wealthy) people in a community.@alanatwoodars @limerockpark Every fucking year I have a conflict with this race! It’s so annoying! I want to play!This is a certified #badtake. https://t.co/7ALAZxUf8g@L3gg3s @3LionsFan Yah, BOTH cats migrated to my even smaller space on the couch within 20 minutes so I don’t know why I even bother trying to sleep.Officially surrendered my side of the bed to the cats. I put up a strong effort but in the end they fought a stronger battle. It’s cool I like the couch anyway. 🏳️🏳️🏳️@igknighted08 I always wanted a front row callup for a neutral start race!!I won the race to the race to the race. What do I win? https://t.co/1pvEqAyKPq
