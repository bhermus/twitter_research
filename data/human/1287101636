Begins with a p. There‚Äôs a casino.@efacc @resultsboy San Diego, but not really San Diego because once we get there we have to get in a non pressurized tube and travel at the speed of slow via highway to inland CA. Will be in San Diego on Sunday tho.@resultsboy My point was that California as a state better be worth 6 hours of recycled air and limited stretching ability. Having never been to the state or this side of the country, this risk is HUGE.@caloso89 We‚Äôll see. Will report back.@resultsboy This is a weird criticism.‚ÄúEstimated flight time is 5 hours and 47 minutes.‚Äù

Wow California, you better be worth it@jojochrystall https://t.co/wE0zBPOUnXIt‚Äôs go time! #NEbikewalk https://t.co/dJKi0QwfMWI have never been more lost than I just was trying to find the on campus hubway rock at UMass.Spotted: new bike racks being installed near Codman Academy! #dot https://t.co/UMDcyfwIR3Cannot tell you my level of stoke about a six-person, all-woman panel to kick off the NE Bike-Walk Summit with a discussion about the role walking and biking plays in transportation equity. #NEbikewalk@AdamMyerson I am an august baby.

Not saying I won't do it.@resultsboy I don't want to drive to Maine (obvious reasons) OR do a mountain bike race.Now that I have $600 back in my pocket, I'd like to sponsor literally anyone willing to put on a race the weekend of May 19/20.

Nobody plans their entire life around a bike race, not at this level anyway. The only person who makes sure there isn't a conflict on their race date is the promoter.@velocb @resultsboy @3LionsFan @EFTA_1 @kevinorlowski Guys. This is a road race. No fat tires.@resultsboy @velocb @3LionsFan I‚Äôm not promoting that race because USAC would find a way to charge us more for insurance.@AdamMyerson Cool.@resultsboy I can see the budget-breaking tee shirts already.Cool. #TroBroLeon https://t.co/RfbpMFd8PRWatching #TroBroLeon, asking myself: ‚Äúdid @resultsboy design this course?‚Äù@type_iix Mikey and I were racing to 1000 Watts.

Better because of sometimes long, sometimes frustrating community processes (local example, Allston Interchange project) and B. Liable to fail without a proper effort to talk to the people a project will impact.My better half pressed me on this, so I‚Äôll explain a bit. To me, this tweet mocks a process (admittedly a flawed one) that listens mainly to well-represented (read: white, wealthy) people in a community.@alanatwoodars @limerockpark Every fucking year I have a conflict with this race!
