It‚Äôs quite similar to the Zymology.@NicoRustinho All so Premier clubs can go abroad for some big money winter friendlies. Predictably self serving.@JUZZ3R @knockernorton1 Surely you can‚Äôt discount ‚Äòa passion for gingers‚Äô? https://t.co/BCEgLnQi2n@JUZZ3R @knockernorton1 Peasant! The feature is directly for the likes of you with *ahem* agricultural tastes.@JUZZ3R Essential Lotus soft top travel to away games, pre season fixtures in foreign climbs, wheel chairs for team photos, fur trapper hats- all eligible expenditure I presume!?!@JUZZ3R Kabbadi would have put ¬£750 to good use! üëÄ@NicoRustinho You get an extra few days rest while 4-7 teams play a quater final before home advantage in a one legged semi final. Scares the hell out of me. We would beat anyone over two legs.  One off games are a lottery even at home. For extra rest read increased rustiness!!Awaits the video from the Dover chairman bemoaning how much money being nudged out of the playoff places will cost him. #karmaisabitch@Haylz1803 Cheers! In fairness it‚Äôs not often Emma is out on a school night!Dover have got three guys called ‚ÄòMitch‚Äô playing for them. Strewth...@tmb317 @hullhopper @knockernorton1 Blimey!

It was grass when I was there last season. https://t.co/ZI5yGFHDz4@HullKRJ Ohh now you‚Äôve got my attention...Not only will the pathetic casuals be in attendance but also the East Riding cadre of Tranmere supporters club are in attendence. Feel like bloody Cinderella...Bloody hate Derren Brown for a range of reasons- mainly tonight because my wife‚Äôs got tickets and thus he‚Äôs depriving a night at Ferriby watching the football.@petefowlerart It‚Äôs amazing the hair-do you can fashion with a box of orange toffets and some sugar puffs.@graywoodhouse Tony Martin with another strong supporting role. #superhairfightingI can totally understand why Kittel wanted to change teams.The more I see that new Alpacin advert, the more I think it is special.

No histrionics.@Tom_Gayle No worries. That is a problem with football - it lends itself to pedantry!! I have to say the news you relayed about Bury‚Äôs football demise brought me some joy this afternoon.Now we have a 3 point gap should we let Dover win on Tuesday night for laughs?Great days work by @ashtaylor02 !! https://t.co/WsLauEnfro@Tom_Gayle STOP CALLING HIM ASHLEY!!!!@Tom_Gayle I let it ride once but not twice; It‚Äôs AshTON Taylor not Ashley.Couple of goals for Tranmere here... https://t.co/rwPZiyLVLk@garnster Tom Brady?@MrJamesMcMath @itvracing Must have jut started.

Loads of great general football bizniz in here including a personal lament on the passing of Tranmere Rovers‚Äô youth system. Give it a spin for a couple of quid. Profits to local junior football. https://t.co/MayyrtCf5w@NicoRustinho Wrexham have bottled it so badly they probably won‚Äôt even make the playoffs!@NicoRustinho All of them. Not because any of them are any good- there not. Just our ability to avoid success at all costs.@knockernorton1 All the Everton fans avoiding the Champions league...@NicoRustinho üòÇMatt Rheads challenge today was ugly, but still nowhere near as ugly as his actual face... https://t.co/gZOkMfTqsXThe guy is a serial cheat. This is what happens when referees turn a blind eye too often. One minute he is doing this, the next rolling around like he‚Äôs been shot trying to win free kicks. An absolute embarrassment. https://t.co/YZudesziWmYay! Wahey! It‚Äôs @Paris_Roubaix day!!@VFTAE Hey Darren, a least we got our half time cuppa a bit earlier as after a big chunk of the queue joined in the rumpus. Silver clouds and all that...@Junkyard_Fool Ha!
