https://t.co/heOePfVjCQ@TeleFootball @ben_rumsby Surprised @The_FSF don’t know about this, given this piece from 2009 talks about them attending a working party on fixture list, including no “sensitive” fixtures on opening or closing weekend: https://t.co/tWy2zP5Z34@FACupFactfile I thought this was well known? Surely people have noticed none of the big sides play each other on the opening it last day (or Boxing Day)?
Good (old) piece on it here: https://t.co/tWy2zP5Z34@miamibyrne Suspect they’ll get hold of it - throwing punches is one thing but kicking someone in the head when they’re on the floor is plain scummy@miamibyrne Did you take that video?

Not every BNP voter is/was racist, but their vote was.@ToriesLeaveEU That’s not my argument - I’m saying that people were willing to turn to a racist party when it appeared to be offering solutions and naturally abandoned it when they didn’t.Pleased for Chris Hughton - seems a decent sort. Feel for the United fans who travelled for it; going to aways should be a privilege but that looked an ordeal. #MUFC@LiamPaulCanning Second in the table and playing in an inconsequential game. Doesn’t stop it being frustrating to watch but hasn’t revealed anything we don’t already know.@GlennMoore7 Fair to say they were pragmatic but agree those sides were balanced towards attack rather than defence@ToriesLeaveEU The BNP have been “voted into oblivion” because not only were they racist they were woeful and predictably a complete shambles when elected to a role.@luciejones83 @bobbyllew That is precisely how it works - worth remembering that in the equivalent election cycle in 2014 UKIP got the largest share of the vote.Sky commentator: “Bit early [for Brighton] to be running the clock down”
You beautifully naive fool, you.
#BHAMUN@Iamxuub Liverpool have dropped points in 44% of their league matches this season...@KevthePainter2 Hopefully he can shift the dial in Glasgow - lack of experience is obviously a concern but a step up from Murty@KevthePainter2 No particular ill will towards Brighton, but I’m always a fan of calling out hypocrisy!@deano8six You don’t think Arsenal fans are willing to be that petty?And now a rendition of “we support our local team” from the Brighton faithful.
I say faithful; they were less interested in supporting their local team when they were in the third and fourth division... #BHAMUN@deano8six Wonder who you’re thinking of...@joeyzas Compare it with the beauty of “Rashford is Red” - some fan bases just lack imagination.@joeyzas SO generic - just a succession of Da-da-da-[INSERT NAME HERE]“He’s one of our own” really is such a dull chant. It’s so ubiquitous, the irony being that the fans who sing it most support clubs with little in the way of heritage of bringing young players into their side through the academy. #MUFC@digitalspy Can’t wait to see both of them in it.@simon3677 @MediJoshi Wouldn’t want to play in it in again in the near future, but last season was fun - I love that winning it completed the set for us@Ec_foster @josephmdurso That took an iron will while eating one slice at 3.30am...@DooHopper Times are tough...@SebastianEPayne @josephmdurso Be the change you want to see in the world...@josephmdurso Nice to have evidence that I didn’t finish it myself...@josephmdurso You in Millbank? Cold pizza on the 6th floor.@ToriesLeaveEU While I’m no fan of UKIP’s politics there’s a distinction between them and the BNP. I fear it’s too easy to say everyone that voted for them did so to teach the main parties a lesson; I fear some liked what they heard.Only occasions I see this time of day is at the end of a night shift. Shame, seems nice.@WillRayner__ She's got a drivers' licence and a bus pass, but not everybody does...@PaulEmbery I am listening (well, reading) and have asked a question based on it. There’s nothing unwitting in me suggesting that I can’t think of any palatable reason for voting BNP.@PaulEmbery Do you think that’s an acceptable reason to vote BNP? The piece suggests you’re highly sympathetic of those that did, which rather ignores exactly who they opted to court.@DaleJohnsonESPN @M__B_ That makes some sense but will take some getting used to and lead to some disappointed fans (I celebrated because the flag was down)@PaulEmbery Personally I think you too readily excuse those who turned to the BNP knowing full well what they represented and what “solutions” they were proffering.@M__B_ @DaleJohnsonESPN Another big issue - the system will naturally make assistants more reticent but ultimately the side attacking would be stupid to pay attention to the flag and even the ref if they think call is wrong@DaleJohnsonESPN Indeed, though I’m not convinced a World Cup is the best place to learn such things!@DaleJohnsonESPN So they’re running it with two lines, rather than looking at the attacker in relation to the penultimate defender’s line? As I say, they’re presenting it as something it’s not capable of determining (IMO)@DaleJohnsonESPN Indeed and that’s a problem - ultimately pretending the system is capable of determining things that it isn’t. (That said, the line has to have some width, which is technically a margin of error)@DaleJohnsonESPN As a cricket fan I’m well aware that even the best frame movement is limited (thus “rocking and rolling”). Only solution I can see is to have a wider line from the second last defender, providing a margin of error@DaleJohnsonESPN @RorySmith @joekrishnan Which is deeply concerning because I’ve yet to see anything that has convinced me they can be accurate enough about precisely when the ball is played for calls of fine marginsThis United strike partnership was so good that they’re still bagging victories! #MUFC https://t.co/u5iJnj3zdk@KuperSimon Given you (or the ESPN subs) are lauding this tactic as leaving Mourinho behind it seems odd that it demonstrably hasn’t (due to budget, you say) and that he himself has shown how easily it can be negated. Liverpool dropping points in 44% of matches suggests he’s not the only one@MrKoolade @natalie_17 @MUFC_TheRedArmy Good news in that regard - according to the ticket office United’s away allocation was only cut at two grounds this season (Liverpool and Man City)@TimHarford @KuperSimon Given this tactic has “left Mourinho behind” any thoughts on why his team is still above the proponents of it in the league? Worth acknowledging that he’s successfully negated the tactic on numerous occasions by simply playing it long from defence more often@EdenOfTheBridge @RealTalkMUFC It's impossible for two people to single-handedly win the same thing together, chief@KevthePainter2 Indeed.@KevthePainter2 Absolutely! Won’t believe their luck - fair to say the draws have been kind to them (Man City by far their toughest, which says something)No doubt there’ll be lots of talk of Real being worried about playing Liverpool in the final but they’d have bitten your hand off if offered that at the start of the season@sarm0161 Same with FA Cup this year with us against Spurs in the semi@aisghair @NatBatsx In fairness you can understand why someone might think Bono was trying to get cruel and unusual punishment made legal https://t.co/znHTF6g6dn@MrKoolade @MUFC_TheRedArmy Indeed and they said that it would be unsafe to move them so they’re be allowed to stay with what they’be got: https://t.co/m96ojXAoSZ@MUFC_TheRedArmy @MrKoolade The interesting thing being that Newcastle aren’t giving even that - for whatever reason they’ve been given dispensation to keep away fans  entirely in the 3rd tier@MrKoolade @MUFC_TheRedArmy What defines a block?@MUFC_TheRedArmy Cracking - I’m sure we’ll make them very welcome@MUFC_TheRedArmy My concern is the requirement to have some away fans “pitchside” - my argument is we should meet the minimum requirement, rather than giving away one of the best spots in Old Trafford@MUFC_TheRedArmy I had already submitted an item for the next fans’ forum regarding moving away fans from the South East corner - really hope the club does whatever it takes to make it happen.@RealSW19Army BIG Summer ahead@BBCSport The most famous that THEY’VE scored... https://t.co/Upoe3Qommu@ChrisSlegg Lots of people seem to have missed this point. Seems to me a huge change that referees should/must allow play to continue, which will naturally make ARs more reticent@JeffSmithetc Can a member of Jeff’s team please confirm that he’ll attend the safe standing at football debate on 25th June?@MufcSongs Important that people who care about this ask their MP to attend to represent their views and ask the Sport Minister challenging questions on their behalf.

I was referring to Arsenal who look prime for a beating. That said, cracking city so try to enjoy your trip whatever happens.@afcDW Not my argument chief; I’m saying that you obviously don’t know what your fans were singing about their former heroes so I suggest you ask them.@TheArsenalChris Nice effort, but might want to check your figures.@afcDW Interesting that you don’t know what your fans were singing. Ask someone who went.@TikiTakaConnor You don’t need that apostrophe chief.@afcDW Were you at Old Trafford today?
Your fans were busy booing Sanchez when Sir Alex was presenting a gift to your manager. Did you join in the songs about Sanchez? Or Van Persie? Have fun in Madrid...@afcDW Only lack of class on show today was from the away end. Got what they deserved.@Jamesstretford Not sure Juan would have got on the end of that cross...Injury time winners are the best, aren’t they? #MUFCForget this VAR nonsense - let’s first stop this nonsense of giving a Gould anytime a goalkeeper is challenged for a cross. The keeper is allowed to use his hands - that’s a significant advantage without referees incorrectly decreeing that their space is sacrosanct #MUFCTotal lack of width from United means Arsenal are getting away with having all 11 men within the width of the box. #MUFC@LouUtd @93rdmin Nah, he’s not alone at failing on the big stage and wanting an easier life.

Shame. #MUFC@LouUtd @93rdmin Who can be arsed?I appreciate the Arsenal fans are at a low ebb, but that’s no excuse for slandering Sanchez’s delightful mutts. #MUFC@JoshRobinson23 The clue would be the lack of empty seats...Arsenal fans too busy swearing about Mourinho and booing Sanchez to notice Sir Alex presenting Wenger with a gift from Manchester United. #MUFCArsenal fans singing about their unbeaten run, fitting to do so where it came to an abrupt end. #MUFC@roathboy Have to assume it was@WalkerMarcus Hours?

It would be interesting what would happen if Salah let it be known that he wants to be refered to as Mohamed, as Andrew Cole did - suspect media would follow suit but suspect fans might be set in their ways@SmithSamuel43 Offering them a choice I absolutely agree with - if Salah says he’d prefer to be known as Mohamed then he should be, I just don’t think there’s anything remotely sinister in names being shortened@muhammadbutt And an example from your employer of going one way in the headline and another in the copy: https://t.co/wqlfnPejYs@muhammadbutt @SmithSamuel43 Here’s an interesting example - the media source refers to Mohamed Salah but his colleague (and captain) refers to him as Mo: 
https://t.co/MTg9dr7vCn@SmithSamuel43 You said they have a duty to attempt to be formal and gave Wilf/Wilfred as your example. So why is Joe a sufficient attempt at formality?
As for Muhammad Ali, I think you’ve missed the point - Maureen doesn’t start with “Mo” but is shortened to it.@SmithSamuel43 @muhammadbutt I was asking you - why is Wilf too informal but Joe not? Interestingly they both have different actual first names (Dazet &amp; Charles) Surely it’s what people chose to be known as?
