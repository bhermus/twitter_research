@Under_Ach1ever @aarongreenberg @sachinbahal Shouldn't really take offense. It's tru.@UKDazarus @NewfNukem I just bought a ps4 pro. I'm not going to subscribe to Playstation plus or anything on it though. Purely got it for games that aren't on Xbox.  I got God of War but I'm playing Twisted Metal Black way more, my fav ps2 game.@AlexSherak 1. Ryse Son Of Rome 2

2. Xbox live is free

3. Ryse 2, Quantum Break 2, Alan Wake 2 and Max Payne 4 are coming@ConcealedBones What colour u go for?@ConcealedBones I vote for.......pale!@Colteastwood Must say thinking of the tweet I just sent out and your one.....the soundtrack in Twisted Metal Black is amazing. Love that game. Love it's music. Just bought a ps4 pro to play God Of War.......I'm playing my fav game from ps2 more, twisted metal blackSo I bought a ps4 pro with God of war 5 days ago. Iv played bout an hour of God of war and probably 3 times that on TWISTED METAL BLACK! Yea God of war is pretty but love me my twisted metal! 
#goinbacktowhereitallbegan wish twisted metal 1 and 2 were on ps4@Colteastwood Never actually sat and listened to a game soundtrack@sixfootcandy @EoW_Pickett My hug always knows when it needs a shower curtain@BoomBoomBetty @EoW_Pickett Fucken aye lol@Colteastwood Fucken aye I'd play it. Would love a 4k back compatible max payne 1 and 2@Colteastwood @verdict4489 Sweet I might give it a look@Colteastwood @verdict4489 Does that bring the colours out a bit more?@ConcealedBones Daaaaym!
Hair looks the shit. Very cool@XAMBTheRealLeek @XboxSupport Yea they have no idea. Nothing showing there end. I'm gonna change providerBeen 4 days now. Before this it was always open NAT. Never had any problems.@XboxSupport hey guys Is there any knowledge yet there about a "double NAT detected" issue? I'm still having it. Nothing is working to fix it. Iv factory reset modem and xbox, tried DMZ, tried port forwarding. Nothing else on my network is getting it only the xbox@verdict4489 X definatly@ConcealedBones Awww shucks üëç@Gib_reel Was just pointing out a fact@Gib_reel How was that stupid?@FlawedExcuses @KBG_Garrett900 @YouTube You'd think so. 80 million ps4 owners. Only 3 million get the game first week. Let's say it's total sales will be 6 or 7 million, that still leaves 73 million ps4 owners who didn't get it at all. Yet "exclusives matter".@Colteastwood Cause its not a Sony game@Zorine Lol üòÇüòÇ ok u can be ausie again now@Zorine Go the KIWI@Zorine üòÄ sweet. So good to see New Zealanders doing so well üòâ@Zorine As a New Zealander can I claim your a kiwi and celebrate a kiwi being at the Texas tekken 7 showdown?@MetalJesusRocks @MaseratiUSA Does it come in 8bit@ConcealedBones Holy moly üò¶
Thank u for sharing@XboxSupport Thanks iv written a post there. Hopefully it gets seen@TWTHEREDDRAGON You bored or something?@XboxSupport I'm in preview program and have reported it. Is it a known issue there?@XboxSupport Yea iv done all that. The thing is it's been perfectly fine until 2 days ago, was open NAT always has been then all of a sudden strict and double nat detected. Nothings changed my end, my isp can't see any issue so how has it changed all of a sudden.Anyone else having NAT issues all of a sudden on xbox? Mines come up saying double NAT detected? Never had that always been open NAT. Now this and it's strict NAT. Is this a known issue?
@Xbox @XboxSupport@trustpower hey guys I'm getting a double NAT detected error which is cramping everything I do online. Just started last night, nothing has changed on my end, what's causing this?@ConcealedBones Omg CHICKENS!!@JezCorden Dirt 4........sweet mean new car@Kmega4 You lucky shit@EoW_Pickett @sparkylink Vamp in Metal Gear Solid 2@SeaOfThievesHQ Fucken aye!@TheAshenLuca Some of us just like playing games no matter where they come from. I didn't choose xbox for its exclusives I just like everything about xbox and have since original xbox when I switched from ps2.@JezCorden Perhaps halo 6 is pretty much done, team moves over to get mcc 4k, release both this year at same time halo 6 and mcc 4k update.....that would be cool@aarongreenberg @BenzMl @Xbox_Addictt @Xbox @Microsoft @XboxP3 Thank you aaron and everyone at Xbox for there support of Matts family. So good to see our community all coming together for him on twitter. Proud to be part of it.@leejohn55268944 @Griffin_Gaming Not hard there's 30 million more ps4s sold than xbox. Bigger player base to sell to. Still fact is they run better on the X. I didn't say anything about sales. Frankly I don't give a shit about sales. I enjoy the games not the numbers@JezCorden Hell yea@BeastFireTimdog Hell yea man. Your one of the few more respected honest guys out there.@ConcealedBones Go you!!@KJWGAMINGHDYT Pretty pathetic isn't it. Some people are just lost I think.@Griffin_Gaming If u prefer PC cool stay there. People who don't want a PC but want a console there are many reasons to have a xbox. To your first tweet halo.being one of them. Best console multiplats being another@Griffin_Gaming Lol your changing what your first said. You said halo is going to PC what's the point of having an Xbox now. I'm answering you and have answered you 3 or 4 times now.@Griffin_Gaming You are ignoring my point. People who are on console are because they prefer it. On console xbox X has the best versions of the multiplats. On console if u want to play halo as per your first tweet you have to have an Xbox.@Griffin_Gaming Also if there on the X they will have the best versions of the multiplats so there's plenty of reasons to have an Xbox.@Griffin_Gaming You said because of halo going to PC what's the point of having an Xbox.  For a console gamer can they play halo on Playstation or Nintendo?........no they can't.  So for halo and any other xbox exclusive a console gamer needs an Xbox@Griffin_Gaming Go build a decent PC that can do what the X does for $500. Will be tough. People who game on console do it cause they prefer it. So yes there is still a reason to have an Xbox or any other console@Griffin_Gaming You guys are all stupid. If this freaks you out go outside and play on a swing or something. Who cares if a halo online is going to PC.  People get a console cause they like the simplicity of it. It's on PC hey guess what Microsoft owns windows it's still Microsoft exclusive@The_CrapGamer Ryse and titan fall I was hyped for. The drm didn't bother me one bit. My console was always online back then as it is now so didn't bother me the whole check in thing. I liked what they were gonna be doing.@TWTHEREDDRAGON Dragon you know as well as anyone if God of war was an Xbox game and it wasn't hitting 4k on the X everyone would be giving them shit.@Colteastwood Love all the updates. So many games I wish would get one. Dirt 4, dirt rally, gta 5, gta 4, Battlefield 4 really want battlefield 4 to get an update@YourBoyGibo I havnt for a while. Did look at it last night, might jump on it tonight@JezCorden I'm buckling and thinking of getting a ps4 pro. The god of war pull is strong but even stronger is the old school Twisted Metal games I wanna play, twisted metal black especially.@steinekin @ThisGuyTomTV Thinking I might have to get a ps4 for this game.....and twisted metal, love me the old twisted metals. God of war looks pretty dam good@Griffin_Gaming @XboxQwik Totally agree. People thinking that the xbox execs shouldnt play competition games is getting ridiculous. They are gamers aswell and should play whatever the hell they like on whatever platform they like. There not "advertising" for the competition there just playing the game@SEastw00d @He_Bot8 @New_Legal_ @JamieMoranUK @Erok8150 @microboxofx @liredbone @Kmega4 @Jlong908 @SEGA4EVA1 @DirectXMinusThe @amckie1986 @xxxcupchuck @GhostRyder730 Lol yea. Played it through twice back then to see both sides of the story. Just finished 3rd play through last week on the X.@He_Bot8 @New_Legal_ @JamieMoranUK @Erok8150 @microboxofx @liredbone @Kmega4 @Jlong908 @SEGA4EVA1 @DirectXMinusThe @amckie1986 @xxxcupchuck @GhostRyder730 Totally agree man@Allday_Digital @He_Bot8 Yea there is and Sony wouldn't be where they are without it. Don't wish for no competition. Don't play on fan boy console war shit. Enjoy your game and promote it to competition so they do better in turn making your preferred better.@EoW_Pickett @sparkylink I'd say everything going after the first 2 to 3 levels are the best parts of the game@MaxPowerGX @XboxP3 Same mate same.@XboxP3 I know you've heard it before but for the love of God RYSE 2 or QUANTUM BREAK 2 or even ALAN WAKE 2. We need story, mature not kid like story's. New IP is always awsome but so is continuing favorites such as these.@EoW_Pickett @sparkylink Ahhhhh yea there is! The wicker man boss fight is fricken awsome@JayDubcity16 Without competition they wouldn't be where they are.@JezCorden @Rand_al_Thor_19 Neither have i...@4K30compromised Lol go you. Just stating the obvious but you wanna go off parading shit#GamesStruck4 these are 4 of many stand out games I played growing up. Many others I could put https://t.co/1v3zihRE90@ConcealedBones hope your chickens have there shit together today. If not eat a bucket of KFC in front of them....slowly....looking them in the eye. If that doesn't motivate spleen, squish and crackz......all hope is lost get a pigeon@4K30compromised @digitalfoundry That article isn't from Microsoft.  It says it's just going by the patch notes but hasn't been tested lol. Digital foundry tested it. Ps4 pro gets to 4k only when standing still, not moving. As soon as u move it goes down.@4K30compromised @digitalfoundry Lol righto@4K30compromised @digitalfoundry Lol ummmmmm yea ok. You may want to watch the digital foundry video and take note of what they say about the pro before writing something like that https://t.co/ir4DFmmeCD@ConcealedBones I hope spleen wins followed closely by squish. I don't have hope for crackz.............nope crackz I think needs a bit more motivation@JamieMoranUK A 4k update for arkham knight would be sweet@ConcealedBones On the plus side you own 3 chickens@ConcealedBones üòÇüòÇ this truly is a sad day@MattyGamer4life @GamingBoltTweet I like this idea. Keeps games looking there best for longer.@BeastFireTimdog It's so awsome to see everyone's messages. And the xbox team getting in aswell@JezCorden I'd play Mine craft if it all looked like that. There's an idea, minecraft mature editionCheck it out everyone the best xbox podcast around. https://t.co/a6hLj5VlVr@XboxQwik So do I.  I think he would like to have another adventure. I think many a xbox gamer would like to take him on a new adventure@ConcealedBones Missed it tonight. Will try catch you tomorrow.@ShawnRAshmore could you do please go to @remedygames and sit in @SamLakeRMD 's chair and say your not leaving till they confirm and sign that they will make Quantum Break 2 then go to @Xbox and give it to @XboxP3 and sit in his chair until they get it done. 

Thanks
Xbox gamer@JamieMoranUK Same. It's awsome on the X and day one console@ConcealedBones Well its Wednesday where I am in the world so let me fill you in on the rest of your Tuesday. ...Probably more snow, maybe a bit more cranky. On a better note The Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises 4k blurays arrived.....but that's only good for me I guess.
Enjoy rest of your day@TWTHEREDDRAGON None of them have been disappointing.  Iv been on Xbox since the very beginning and have enjoyed every Gen.  What's disappointing is the people this Gen being so dam whiney and bitchy about every little dam thing. Very silly poll in my opinion. Your starting to look like IGN üòê@The_CrapGamer @YouTube Will suck if they don't show decent games. Won't be done for me just will suck putting up with hearing it over n over@creepypuppet @GraceRandolph Pretty sure people on the Internet don't know how to be nice anymore@RondaRousey @NatbyNature I'll be your friend if you be mine üòä@la_dynamita Cool might have a nosey. Any u can name off the top of your head that are must haves?@DocCupCake84 @BeastFireTimdog @TheDivisionGame @Xbox @LGUS @mattshotcha It's pretty fricken sweet now isn't it. It look awsome before the update but now just absolutely stunning@SnoopyG7 Fuck yes! I miss Twisted Metal. This would be awsome. Not under the forza name but using there tech hell.yea@la_dynamita Tru are there a few mods for Xbox that make it look better? Like texture mods that kinda thing?@PopCultured4 Perhaps Red Dead Redemption doesn't like you@PopCultured4 Can't say I ever encountered any bugs in all my playtime on it. Maybe the wild west just isn't your thing.@JamieMoranUK Watched The Dark Knight last night and that was pretty awsome looking@JezCorden Nope.@ConcealedBones @QueenEliminator @BritniCoggin Look forward to your next stream ü§ò@BeastFireTimdog I'm happy. Dunno why everyone is so bitchy. Games will come have patience. Remember ps4 had a "sparce" year now look where they are, xbox going through the same thing@Colteastwood  https://t.co/F6yKvWLIpe@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Whatever that might be@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON I get that for some people. For me I prefer xbox so I didn't care about it costing more. The power difference was annoying only because where ever I looked online or on Twitter it was shoved down our throats. I still enjoyed the games. Am looking forward to what's coming@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Yep and games take time. Like I said they sorted the services, sorted the hardware now as Phil said months ago there investing heavily in games@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Yea they would of cared no matter the price@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Everyone is on at them about there first party that's what I'm referring to@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Yea that's what I just said. The argument everyone is having is xbox has no exclusives from t first party@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON So it's ok for Sony to have no games for a period but when Microsoft does everyone spits it in there face.  

They sorted the service, they sorted the hardware now it games.  Games take time. Give them time to do it@Kenji35Kt @jez7780 @TWTHEREDDRAGON Power was the issue. Look back at all game launches on the big sites. Almost every one noted how it ran better on ps4. They wanted to stop that and they did. Couple years back Sony themselves said there lineup was "sparce" but as said by a big news outlet "but that's genius"@BaloneyMontana @Konami @Xbox Hell yea I was just thinking this!@KBG_Garrett900 Your not alone mate lol kinda crazy seeing how people react to this. I'm more than happy with xbox, the one thing we know is games are coming our way. Sure we don't know what yet but great games are coming our way.I started the game Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice https://t.co/KEhT0Ur4GY@JezCorden @Ramb0sCorner Same here. Just finished 3rd play through.@JezCorden Close or even up with these are..
Farcry 5
Forza Horizon 3
Rocket League
Cod WW2
Gears of War ultimate edition
Gears 4@JezCorden No particular order.
Ryse Son Of Rome
Battlefield 4
Doom
Quantum Break
Dirt Rally@Dealer_Gaming @Colteastwood Agreed. He did mine for me aswell.@RareLtd Can't wait!@aarongreenberg The OG xbox games list and Red Dead in 4k!@JackOfKnaves @Polygon Not this awsome@MrTucaroo @nmb3sixty @DestinLegarie Sooooooooo not overvalued my friend. Once you see it you'll find it hard going back. Get off the exclusive horse, most people don't want the hassle of building a PC and maintaining it (firmware updates, random problems) and love console as its easier and the X is the best console@Kmega4 Gonna buy that when I get home@Jwags412 @Under_Ach1ever @Colteastwood @zaire2005 @KBG_Garrett900 @Kmega4 @NoahJOsborne @Nethilez @DefJamBam @DragnMOOR7 Ryse@SpOoNmAn360 There was a story on a game the other day that does that. A reviewer got banned from xbox live for posting video in his review. It had light sexual content or something. Havnt heard about it for farcry though@FINALLEVEL @Markis5150 Dam straight! Most sensible thing I've seen said from a gamer in years@Sawtooth_75 @itsSCOTTYDOG Wish they'd do a patch for bf4 on Xbox one x.@JezCorden Oh look how cute, power matters again@TheWelshGamer93 @The_CrapGamer Have to agree with you. His choice in titles for his videos sometimes baffles me. I don't watch as much as I used to .@EricV703 @CrazyCableGuy @Tyler496 @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON I didn't point them out as a victory. I was answering the guys question as he said Microsoft doesn't get them any more@CrazyCableGuy @Tyler496 @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON Yea hopefully they do@CrazyCableGuy @Tyler496 @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON It doesn't matter where they are. There still gonna be there. Games will come.@CrazyCableGuy @Tyler496 @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON No idea what the point is, the stuff they put in is usually stupid cosmetic things for character's. Doesn't interest me. E3 we will start to see the games. As Phil said last year first they wanted to get the service right then the hardware and now they are focused on games@CrazyCableGuy @Tyler496 @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON I don't care if there's extra content or not. Was just answering your comment about them not getting marketing with multiplats.@CrazyCableGuy @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON I like better looking games. Doesn't bother me how many exclusives it has or doesn't have@CrazyCableGuy @Tyler496 @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON Anthem, battlefield 5, borderlands, cyberpunk 2077, madden all rumored to be Microsoft marketed.@Tyler496 @CrazyCableGuy @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON There's another one. Again how's it not worth it? It cost the same as the base xbox one did at launch@CrazyCableGuy @InkabodCrane @TWTHEREDDRAGON Sorry but your comment about there being no value in owning the X unless you like halo gears forza makes u look like u have an agenda. How is there no value when every game looks and runs better on it?@remedygames @SamLakeRMD Thank u for the X patch. Loving playing this through a 3rd time. Make a sequel guys......Oh and Max Payne 4........and maybe squeeze in Alan Wake 2........please üòäüòäüòä@Under_Ach1ever @Colteastwood Focus was all on power. Xbox had the better launch line up and the multi plats were better on ps4 and that's what everyone went with. "1089p makes u a better gamer" IGN was the worst. Ps4 line up was sparse so all was on power
