@SMEChristy Appreciate it!@robertkenward Should be!Facebook is considering an ad-free subscription model as an option for users. Would you be interested in that option? If so, what's the maximum you'd pay monthly? https://t.co/F0YFt736zF https://t.co/BjZk5BJtXp@lcalderwood @SantoroMilena @theEVENTmpi I‚Äôd recommend it to Americans too!Looks like @Entrepreneur has tips on getting the most from trade shows. https://t.co/RdJcLwUZjr https://t.co/o3sgGSuI3jI hear it's National #MeetingPlannersAppreciationDay. I think our industry deserves to be celebrated at every opportunity, especially in the US, right now. As the forces pulling us apart grow stronger, those who organize gatherings become more important for our future.Instagram might be bringing direct payments through their app. Snapchat already does this. Seems like that's where this is going, marketers. 
https://t.co/xC0re2ukZx https://t.co/CyVesc7AC8Happy Cinco de Mayo and Kentucky Derby Day! Here's a recipe for a Mint Julep Margarita because there's no reason to pick just one thing to celebrate at a time! 
https://t.co/RseeSWJpnC https://t.co/uH4zXojAeU@miguelseven @SocialMChefs I‚Äôm the past 6 months I‚Äôve enjoyed LinkedIn more than I ever have. I‚Äôve also pulled out of Snapchat so I have had the time to invest.@khartline I‚Äôm not. I haven‚Äôt had a formal relationship with them in over a year. That said, happy to hear your feedback in my DMs. https://t.co/FemI7SuN3EHarvard Business Review weighs in on a topic I spent a lot of time with this past year: personality-based marketing (and social listening). 
https://t.co/n0O52HU0EB https://t.co/uwRNpXg88WCambridge Analytica is calling it quits today. Which blows my mind because...they've continued being a thing for the last few months??@SocialMChefs Appreciate the read &amp; share! I'd love to see a social media platform take on matchmaking for networking...especially one with an active user base (sorry, LinkedIn).@GreatPromos Yeah, no one is smart enough to fool everyone.@CMIContent @gleecontent Loving this! My air conditioner is in even!@gleecontent Thanks so much for moderating! #expochatI created a free event influencer marketing webinar with @hubbdotme recently. Feel free to check it out here: https://t.co/lZw5aNqkRP #expochat@DonnaKastner As a speaker, is it not already an obvious transactional relationship? What about employees of a company advocating on its behalf? #expochat@gleecontent A7 An example of "doing it wrong": The Fyre Festival. Influencers took the money and ran without understanding who they were dealing with. #ExpochatA6 Compensation for influencers depends on goals and expectations. It's not one size fits all and should be monitored and fair. #expochat https://t.co/tIx2uDsBv9FYI, @snoballevent &amp; I will be joined by @MelissaBrandle tonight streaming live at 5pm EST for #EventIcons as we discuss influencer marketing for events. https://t.co/MTh7CZkOKS #expochat https://t.co/TBPnK6B8NZ@tamarbeck1 Yeah, it's usually in their voice change or advocacy for arbitrary brands that have no direct correlation to their focus. #expchat@DonnaKastner My contracts for speaking are requiring me to advocate for the event more and more often. #expochat@snoballevent @gleecontent I think there's a forthcoming solution to this coming... *wink* #expochat@gleecontent Depends on the investment and scale of goals. If large on one or both - I think it's a wise insurance policy. #expochat@CMIContent @gleecontent Enjoying this Cleveland weather? #expochat@tamarbeck1 You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but not everyone all the time. :) I think in the long run, the inauthentic ones give themselves away. #expochat@gleecontent A5 I'll say it so Rachel doesn't have to - @snoballevent! I had the pleasure of being empowered by them this year when promoting @pcmahq's Convening Leaders and it was incredibly helpful for me as an influencer (they also had record attendance!)  #expochat@TSNN_Rachel @DonnaKastner A4 I've been contracted to cover exhibitions as well as even exhibitors at shows and I disclose that I'm a member of their team. I only use my channels to promote things I believe in. Overlapping missions are where partnerships begin. #expochat@tamarbeck1 I've been on both sides. When it's a partnership and based on shared missions, the transactional element is totally fair, in my opinion. An influencer only has so much time in their day. If you want some of it...there is a cost. #expochat@gleecontent Beat me to it. Ha. When I've been contracted as an influencer, I've taken this as far as I can. Anyone with a career in a field shouldn't throw their credibility away for a little money.A4 Read and contractually obligate everyone (at least in the US) to follow the FTC Guidelines for endorsement. https://t.co/mHRokhPmMa #expochat@TSNN_com_US I love business cat.@johnDmartinez On all sides but especially (and legally) from the influencer. #expochat@johnDmartinez We did! When they are partners because you both share the same mission, it's very different than a transactional audience boost. #expochatQ3b A pitfall to avoid when utilizing influencers would be when brands dictate how an influencer should advocate for you. Their authenticity is their most important quality. Don't take it away from them. You'll both lose. #expochat https://t.co/DS4qaGtyRDA3a Challenges to influencer campaigns seem to be transparency but, that shouldn't be a challenge...it should be an opportunity. Transparency is vital for long term success. #expochat https://t.co/uDy8or5R04A2 I've been on both sides of the influencer fence a number of times. Going from influencer to ambassador is a logical evolution for event brands. #expochat https://t.co/N03fFmDciqA2 Events should also recognize who is passionately sharing information about their event the most, in the moment, and reward them.  #expochatA2 Events should engage influencers beyond just thier ability to sell tickets through social media. They should impact design as well because they are tastemakers and they represent an audience.  #expochat@johnDmartinez @gleecontent I love running Twitter Audit :) https://t.co/1v1BhjHz31 works for Instagram too. #expochat@cvent @TSNN_Rachel Indeed! That's why I love face to face. I can look you in the eye and ask you questions without the aid of Google. @expochatA1b Social listening, polling, and an assessment of value-alignment are where I focus. #expochat https://t.co/qibVZLMx0w@cvent A1 Mission-centric value offered to followers is what I look for too. #expochat@TSNN_Rachel A1 Everything else can be faked except long-term credibility. #expochatA1 Credibility is the most important trait in an influencer.  #expochat https://t.co/fnrLQsGAJNHi!

I‚Äôll be speaking on the topics with @helloendless #eventicons as well tomorrow!Are all male panels dying? I sure hope so! Manels are symptomatic of planners who are on auto-pilot.

What's something that you think Airbnb can never duplicate from hotels?
https://t.co/b5niBOttMb https://t.co/tOU5sfVSsmI believe any event can benefit from an influencer marketing strategy because designed experiences and influencers both serve communities. https://t.co/7FBF6vDJCB@Pernilleanderse Hope to demystify a lot of the changes that have happened on Facebook!@paultobey Get that trademark!@alanberg Thanks, Alan!Being called Mr. Borelli will never not be weird to me.Incredibly impressed by the story and vision of @paultobey.

I'm loving their perspective on this type of strategy.@YouTooSM do you have a WiFi password?@GreatPromos @Uber Short trip. I just watched the road too!Looks like @Airbnb had a widget now which will make it easier for event organizers to offer that option on their websites. Curious to see it this takes off.

https://t.co/v8faa6JNbx https://t.co/c2jlGqRFX6Last week @LuiSays really got in my head with his unique take on the event industry's attitude on food waste.

So excited for a day of Braindates on Friday! #Expochat@stephselesnick Packing for Canada tomorrow. Ha. At home in Cleveland.@stephselesnick A5 Good thing! Closing can take place online or via phone just easy. Use Face to Face for trust building. #ExpochatAll my tweets were sent at once. Weird.  #Expochat https://t.co/2AAki1OizrA5 Explicit non-harassment policies and push towards diverse representation in programming.  #ExpochatA5 emphasis on brand activations vs. sales in exhibition. #ExpochatA2 A registration process that required you to partially self-register, get in a line to get your badge, then go to another line to get your bag.  #expochatA2 A conference with a leaderboard for attendees who use the # the most. Totally ruined the hashtag because people were posting anything just to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.  #expochatA1 I walked into @WizardWorld Cleveland to Kato Kaelin welcoming attendees right at the door from a small stage at the entrance.  #ExpochatA1 LOVED that I could register for @pcmahq Convening Leaders at the airport. Felt welcomed and organized to the fullest degree. #Expochat@kimestep @stephselesnick Very slight but still disappointing@MaryKlida When is spring coming for us in this region?!?Nick Borelli here!
