Firmino is a FW his job is to score goals/compare him with Lukaku https://t.co/i7rWDsML3ILingard disappered yesterday yet played almost 90mins. Shaw didn't do anything bad either still hooked him at HT for Young. Pogba at his worst would surpass that Lingard showing Imo https://t.co/W2sq63OMaR@markgoldbridge Lingard is such a very average player. He had some recent good form/heroics but never good for utd😑@SkyKaveh They wouldn't have been that good they're now.
