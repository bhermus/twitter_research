@EliEaston ❤️@oftenimprudent  https://t.co/QpnGMC24UZA tragic jewelry making accident. https://t.co/LET7aLSbmPA tragic jewelry making accident. https://t.co/779qKtJif0A tragic jewelry making accident. https://t.co/nk1MnnSygR@ladrianaherrera Agree. Thank you for pointing it out!@SashaDevlin Love it!@ladrianaherrera Was literally talking about this yesterday with another author. Thanks for calling it out.@Annie_FTtBR Wow!!!I was tagged by @EliEaston to do the 7/7/7 challenge. :)  7th page, 7th line, 7(ish) sentences.

This is from Alpha Heat, Xan's book. Due out in the next 2 weeks. :D https://t.co/k2CmD6mHRz@Sarah_Allan IT IS!!!!!!!! 🎉Things to do before I can pub this book:
1) write one scene
2) proof it
3) have it formatted

So I need to write this scene, y'all. *cracks knuckles* *yawns* 

Maybe after I nap.@IsagelC Sending you strength. Wish I could help more tangibly.Thread. https://t.co/jzBfAPAZKO*tilts head* I see truth in this thread. https://t.co/SWNe2zPYwX@brownbookworm @diversebooks 😱😩😱😩😱Michael Jackson

??? Prob someone my kid wants to see or Tori again. https://t.co/bpuKrdx5B0TFW you were a jerk to your hub and apologized but he’s a Taurus so you gotta be miserable for two days because you were a dick for three minutes. 😩@Cassandra_Carr 👍🏻 Cool. I can see how I didn’t express my thought that clearly.@Cassandra_Carr I didn’t mean that you saw the tweet. In my kid’s school, when they see something that makes them think of something else, they say, “Related!” And then give their thought. I meant that I saw your tweet and it made a good thought companion w the other one.@Cassandra_Carr I’m not sure what you mean by “actually no”? I see a similarity between the expressed thoughts of you and the other person. There really isn’t a place to say “No, you’re wrong to see a similarity.”I feel like this relates back to the RT I made earlier about rabbis and absurd yet deadly serious topics. https://t.co/VUXoJU2tbmThread. https://t.co/11yIz2vgCAhttps://t.co/tk1smqiTZ5@nishaanned let no one ever claim that patience is my best event. I literally had to wait only one more scene. OMG.My mom after reading my second book: Well, this was no Training Season. 

😂

Don’t you want to read that book now?! https://t.co/Zw5DfyYRQO@nishaanned tell me we find out about the dark secret in Rachel’s past!!!!! (Finally catching up on unREAL.)@_AJCousins @deannaraybourn Yes! Such an amazing opening line!!!@Pochiperpe @MiaReadsBooks ❤️❤️❤️❤️@arianard137 I have complicated ideas about how their relationship works. Watching it makes me want to write a book with a similar dynamic...@MiaReadsBooks Thank you so so so so much!!! https://t.co/vVk8PMJuyUhttps://t.co/SnOwxOpehXhttps://t.co/ZfUjmG6jypTOO SHABBY. Gah. I can spell and use words sometimes.Wait today is the 30th. 😆And I have a terrible headache so I’m finishing the month 600 words shy of 70k. Not to shabby. I had a goal of 50k and exceeded it.If I can write 600 words tomorrow then I will have written 70,000 words in April. Hot damn. I think I can make that happen.Merlin rewatch convo:

Hub: Is she evil now? Is that why she’s wearing so much eyeliner? 

Kid: She’s almost evil and, yes, the eyeliner may be causing it.

😂My character Matty has been silent for a long time. This song woke him up a bit. He’s all, “Hey, I have ideas.” And I’m all, “No sir! I got other plans!”
https://t.co/fv3NClR1DsShopping w kiddo today, a tune comes on, I start bopping a bit to the beat.
Kid: Mom, stop. You’re embarrassing.
Me: Awesome you mean.
Kid: No.
Me: *bops more*
Kid: *rolls eyes* *sighs heavily* God, I love you.https://t.co/xX91BVUUyuhttps://t.co/bvupD1ano3@mel_thegreat Gorgeous!!@KarrieGeorge_ Same. 🙌🏻@KarrieGeorge_ Oh mine would never say childcare was easy but I do think it’s an “until you’re the go-to parent you just don’t know” sort of thing. Like they don’t really get it.@LiberalLecter Trump being in office shows the most disrespect for the office possible. It’s made the office a farce.@KarrieGeorge_ Ha! He didn’t do that! But he’s in charge of the food sitch in the house all time anyway. But I was surprised he didn’t call about her schedule which is pretty complicated. She kept him on track with it. 😂 I wish he’d had the toddler experience!! Then he’d be so impressed w me!@KarrieGeorge_ 😂 I hear you! Much the same!@thatmissp  https://t.co/oO8b1uvu46@thatmissp Staying alone in a hotel is one of my true joys in life. LOVE IT.Re-evaluates self-identity bc of tweet...

Can one of my genders be bi and the other pan and the other straight and the other gay? FFS gender fluidity effs this up for me.

*sticks with pan* https://t.co/1fCyXBvcnLSo I get home yesterday and he’s all, “Doing EVERYTHING for her, taking her ALL THE PLACES is exhausting.” 
Me: “So you have some appreciation now for all I do?” (Left out that she’s literally the easiest she’s ever been in some ways.)
Him: “I did before but even more now.”
Me: https://t.co/lT4QKXBv3RSo I was gone a week and for the first time ever my hub watched the kid completely on his own while I was gone. Keep in mind she’s a tween now and mostly self-regulating. (TBF his former job schedule prevented him from ever taking this on before, wasn’t by choice.) 1/2@rocknrollsoapbx @misskadimarie @clarencebrown Theater is important!!The Strip, Knoxville circa 1994. A guy I knew leaned against a utility post. I couldn’t place where I knew him from (classes? coffee shop? library?) but he looked right at me expectantly so I gave a bright smile &amp; a cheerful, “Hi!” Twenty steps later: Oh! That was Michael Stipe. https://t.co/UAMCTS0A7FLeta Blake on Pinterest! :D https://t.co/pL3RTDU83t🖤 NEW IN KINDLE UINLMITED!!! 🖤

MY AUTISM AWARENESS BLOG POST: https://t.co/9jnWuO2HSW https://t.co/RcOzq7o0AW@misskadimarie @clarencebrown You're awesome! And it has to be that first one! THANK YOU SO MUCH! &lt;3@clarencebrown That sounds most probable given the lyric I remember! 😃 Hooray! This gives me a place to start. Thank you! I wonder if the library has recordings of plays going back that far...@misskadimarie @clarencebrown Hmm. None of those seem quite right. Do you have easy access to the next few years too? I feel sure it was early 90s and not late 80s because I could drive. Thank you!!!!!Drank coffee late to meet my word count goals and am now all 😃😃😃at 2am. Got 8k though so...🎉 

Now. How does sleep work?@iSmashFizzle @CSiriano 💖💖💖💖💖💖@meganaderr I beliiiieeeeeve! https://t.co/8EAdQDwerphttps://t.co/HN9KUBq0gihttps://t.co/77ErwczR59@meganaderr You had me at forced marriage and then you HAD ME at Count of Monte Cristo (with magic). https://t.co/guuBYntm6TGah. There is *something* this reminds me of. Someone. Oh oh oh!!!! Nick Drake! With a touch of Sting. Which...is weird but yeah.https://t.co/GGzj75lbPShttps://t.co/YsTNNCtspChttps://t.co/3TTmBXXmwxhttps://t.co/o1zvLU6zQQ@Aszabla @audible Gay ice foreverrrrrrr https://t.co/7pCcTNLOGeJanelle Monae is so gorgeous that she makes me feel a bit faint tbh. https://t.co/ZEutf6Rmfxhttps://t.co/Y8mDtMgc4wI bet if I went to the UT library and spent a few hours, I could have all these questions answered. That's why librarians are awesome.Or get a recording of that song that comes and goes like an ear worm for the last 20 years. This would have been around 1990, by the way. Perhaps a bit later. 3/3There's nothing on Google for it. I suspect it was a show that never ran again anywhere else. It may have been a visiting professor's show. Id' love to know more about this and if there is a way to view a recording of it in the library at UT maybe. 2/3Back when I was a teenager, the Clarence Brown Theater ( @clarencebrown ) put on a show that featured, IIRC, an all black cast. I remember little else about it except these lyrics from one song: A nightingale lights on my fence every morning. What was the name of the play? 1/2If you aren't following this photographer on Instagram, you should be! :D
