Enter to win a fabulous Freewrite distraction-free smart typewriter from @Astrohaus! #giveaway #amwriting  https://t.co/QsXkgEb2FmWhew! I haven't been on here in a while, but who can resist the president live tweeting his road to impeachment?!@AnneRiley @hayfarris @MeganWhitmer @FeakySnucker @gmc511 I'm so glad to hear this!!Let's see a show of hands. Who else is about to lose their husband to basketball for a while? #marchmadness@nicsigni Happy birthday! 30 has been the best for me. I hope it is for you as well!!In hindsight, opting to go to the Target Starbucks *may* have been a bad idea. But at least we got cute stuff. üòÇ@KatyUpperman oh man, I'm jealous! This is far and few between over here.@eltheriault my mom does this. She drinks at least six cups of tea a day and uses the microwave every time. I should prob buy her a kettle.Gave up FB for Lent and my mental health. Now I'm getting texts from FB about tags and mentions. What is happening?! #givemesomespaceI'm hosting a @theactionnet event: Inverness/Oak Mountain Huddle. RSVP here: https://t.co/cUAlhttxdPWtf @Twitter https://t.co/okFbMBKIKoDoes anyone else feel like we're doing cheetos a disservice by referring to DT as one? #heisorange #butilikecheetos@laurenduca Thank you for an incredible article! I'm so grateful for brave, truth-telling women in this world. Keep going!Gave dry needling a shot today. Holy heck that is painful stuff.Oh! Has anyone gotten a #daith piercing for #migraines? I really want to hear from ppl who've done it.Do you use a pen name? How did you decide what name to use?@SarahTolcser That's where I am. If I don't step away from FB soon, I may have a breakdown.@MorrowJaime it's so awful. Can we move up? I'm still wrapping my head around the fact that my children are surrounded by these ppl.@SarahLBlair I've been out of the Twitter loop too long. Just saw your book is out. Grabbing it now!STRESSSSSSSSS. My stomach is in knots, but I can't look away from the returns.@AnneRiley Yeah! That's awesome!! Cheers to writing at all!I wonder if I continue to sign up for NaNo because I subconsciously enjoy the guilt of not keeping up.At the point in this #NaNoWriMo2016 journey where I'm typing AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS just to move on and keep going. It's too soon.How's #NaNoWriMo2016 going?? https://t.co/GKOfyPYI26Spoonies, I'm sending love and hoping that on this day, you have a few extra. #spoontheoryYou know, I thought I understood the #SpoonTheory, but now that I have regular debilitating migraines, it has taken on a new meaning for me.@JimMcCarthy528 Haha! That's hilarious.Who else is having ALL the emotions over the #GilmoreGirls trailer?And let's be honest. Sewing is not one of my strengths. Thanks, Halloween.#ParentingAdvice: don't ask your kids what they want to be for Halloween. Take them shopping and make them choose. Or you'll end up sewing.@MorrowJaime That's true. You've got this. You can pack all the things!@MorrowJaime Oh yes, that is good. But also harder. I'm much better at packing when we move cities and terrible house to house. üòÇI love the latest reboot of Sesame Street and so do my kids. ALL three of them will sit and watch it. #parentingwin@MorrowJaime Are you guys moving to a new city?Is anyone else craving chocolate cake right now? No? Just me then.Why has a leaf vacuum not become a thing yet? Why blow the leaves when you could suck them into a bag?! Bonus points if it's also quiet.I want that to change. For my daughter and for many others too. Where do I start?In the media, in print, everywhere. Lots of ppl have different types of marks, but majority of society doesn't know anything ab them.Sweet daughter has a facial birthmark &amp; the more I've thought ab it, the more I want to start a body positive movement toward seeing thoseI'm happy that I feel better, but that is not going to work out well on weekdays.Finally got meds for my migraines. Took one this morning as I felt one coming on and subsequently crashed for FOUR hours. üò≥üò≥Thanks to @GilbertLiz and Big Magic, I'm officially knocking short stories out into the wild! Here's to the many rejections I'll receive!@AnneRiley hahaha! Dad humor. You've gotta love them.Husband revised previous to house jail. Haha! How often do parents lie to their kids I wonder.Husband told our boys that if you eat your boogers, you'll go to jail. Oldest responded that that was bad news for some ppl in his class. üòÇThe baby is officially army crawling. She's a tiny unstoppable force, and I'm both proud and terrified. Going to need a few of these. https://t.co/kT3VWzrIWhProductive day over here. Anyone else? https://t.co/ek5eTN4sxx@rallenac But after a few years, he loved our cat. Sadly, he went missing back in June.@rallenac yeah, I've heard it's fairly painful. JD claims he's not a cat person.@rallenac Declawing is pretty mean though. No wonder she bites! Her name is Nikki, right?Morning, y'all! https://t.co/RyreMzYezK@rallenac I just saw your tweet. I really should! He'd be so mad though. There's one at the shelter I really want.Today marks the THIRD time this baby has had a diaper explosion in public, and it's ended up on my shirt. üí©üò∑üòµüòîSo he talks to these other people about it but not his running mate?What was that closeup about?  #debate@smreine it's a good word.My three-yr-old secretly recorded me and my husband in conversation, and now I can't stop analyzing my nonverbal communication. Ugh ü§îüò£@MeganErickson_ yeah, I'm giving up on that pursuit. Twitter for the win.I want a new cat. Husband does not. I've started to text him üêàüêàüêà at random times throughout the day. Let's see who breaks first. #wontbemeThanks, Universe. I was looking forward to binging 30 Rock, and now I have to work.The universe is telling to stop procrastinating and write. How do I know? Netflix isn't working in the bedroom.I made the nachos. We'll just call it brunch and let it slide.@SarahTolcser good luck! Deadlines equal a disaster house here. But I'm okay with that. üòÇ@SarahTolcser so much this! I tell mine: you knew who I am when you married me, so it's not like it's new.Is it weird that I'm dreaming of nachos at 9:30 in the morning? If it is, you might want to look away.That doesn't even make sense! Fiction versus real life. Assault versus consent!I just can't with this election anymore. Facebook is asking why women are outraged over DT's words but don't mind reading erotica?!It would probably lose its appeal eventually, but I wish it were always Fall. I love sleeping with the windows open.The combination of clean sheets, freshly shaven legs, and open windows is the best in the world. Saturday night is running a strong game.@YABuccaneers @MariaAnnaWitt @jenpickrell @kfockepearson I revised a bit and added about 300 new words before being called away.@Jamie_Grey I'm so sorry. Sending lots of love.Ummmm. No. https://t.co/ayroyNXUYuEven better? After our rap session, Husband switched to dad mode and read to the boys before bedtime. #hesthebestHusband and I spent a full hour reliving our teenage years with rap videos on YouTube tonight. It was glorious.@AnneRiley yes! I could not figure that out.So I just googled the meaning of TFW because it was starting to make me nuts. #signsimgettingolderSpent the morning hunting Pok√©mon with my kids and the rest of the day hiding inside in AC. I am NOT equipped for this heat.And in between the tough work, I'll be loving my babies and teaching them to love others and advocate for the injustices of our world.I will stand with my powerful black sisters, and we will change this world.And working is what I plan to do. It's time to move past positive thoughts and prayers and get into action. I will use my voice.I took the day away from FB &amp; the news. My heart and soul needed it. It's important to take care of yourself even as you plan on how to helpTwitter is such a better space for me mentally than FB. I love opening it and seeing all of you voice what I'm feeling. Thank you for that.@kathleea I got $25!I think my introvertedness has gone to a new level. Literally hiding in the baby's room wishing extended family would go home. So tired.His teenage son noticed it and ran to get something to kill it, but it disappeared into the bushes and monkey grass. *sets fire to the yard*Neighbor stopped by today for a friendly chat and to let me know there's a large rattlesnake somewhere between our houses. üò≥üò±üò≠@AnneRiley Sweet! I loved The Raven Boys so I'm really excited about this one.But I caught up on GOT today and then jumped into Dream Thieves. Loving both so hard. Esp that last scene last night. #girlpowerTrying desperately to get back into tweeting, but a baby and an introverted brain make it hard.Girls are told to stay small &amp; quiet &amp; competitive. This keeps girls weak &amp; separate, so we can‚Äôt join forces &amp; lead.https://t.co/Llu42CdGNp@KatyUpperman how are you so good at painting them?!Thank God for Twitter! I completely forgot @dljensen_'s Warrior Witch came out this week! SO pumped to finally read it!@nemlas29 it shouldn't be allowed! Our sanity goes into question!I'm so tired. Why does this baby like to be awake during the night?!@AnneRiley exactly! His job sent him to MS. I'm trying not to hold it against them buuuuut... Yeah.My husband will be home SOON! You guys, he's been out of town since predawn Monday, leaving me alone with THREE kids! Three! One is 2 wks üò≥For the love of God, someone please explain how boys tear holes through their pants so often!@TPolen6 Oh gosh! Good luck! Maybe a nap can be your reward? #YABspring2016@TPolen6 well, you probably won't self edit bc you're tired so that's a good thing! Why so little sleep?Anyone working this morning? #YABswb2016@bridgidlee I can't find it. Is it possible that I have a privacy setting blocking it? I feel FB illiterate üòû@bridgidlee Thank you!I'm free to do just a little here and there, and I'm most always impressed with what I get done. This applies to my writing and to life. 2/2
