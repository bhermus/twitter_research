@RavenG93 Thank you Raven, always enjoy yours as well. #gratitudeFulfillment doesn't really come from attainment but from emptying ourselves of that which no longer serves us. #spirituality #consciousnessThe ego has done an incredible job in convincing the masses that they are separate from Source Energy.@LuluPosh Right back atcha!@LuluPosh Just awesome.@MetaphysicGuru Many thanks.

Thank you.@StoriaLockets Many Thanks for the retweets!@MHReal_Estate My pleasure, great to connect!@StoriaLockets Thank You for the retweet!Each and everyone of us is capable of being and extending the most authentic love there is- unconditional love.@Nirajchandra Many Thanks for the retweets, very grateful.@RavenG93 Thank You for the RT!Nothing in this world changes the fact that you are a Divine Being.Unconditional love is so very uncomplicated-no attachments, no expectations.God works in the impossible-this is why divine intervention is often called a miracle.@MayanDreams Many Thanks. #GratitudeBeing human doesn't for one moment diminish your divinity.@StoriaLockets Thanks for the rt!@ScozzariFrank @Donmardak @ambassadorcio @ReedsyHQ @LKGibson900 Many Thanks. #GratitudeThe magic of life is interconnectedness. #oneness@BookViral @P_D_Coach @Ranal55 @GregCichosz @EmmaTeamLYD @TriciaL1448 @StoriaLockets @Dresses4_Prom Many Thanks. #Gratitude@ClaraSteventh @Letsgosocial @thespiritspace @Rokkerillo @Metasouls @modernancientAB Many Thanks. #GratitudeConscious relationships are not where individuals are made complete but where individuals share their completeness. #relationships@StoriaLockets Thank you for the RT!The magic of life is interconnectedness. #onenessLook beyond appearances, nothing in life is separate. Life is oneness.@StoriaLockets Thank You for the RT!Forgiveness without forgetting is not forgiveness at all but a fragment, an imposter of #forgiveness .If you wish to experience unconditional love then extend it. If you wish you experience forgiveness do the same.@Dresses4_Prom continue your great work! #selflessCompassion comes from the understanding and knowing that every other human being is dealing with their own personal adversities.@ooGloryoo @ShamanDrumMaker @RavenG93 @lesl1eanne @thesoulnerd @AnysiaK_Medium @Carlolight @Autumn_Antal Thank You! #GratitudeThere are always two main choices, Love or fear.

If you wish you experience forgiveness do the same.@StoriaLockets Thank You for the RT! #GratitudeThe challenges laid out before you should remind you just how capable you are of succeeding.@BlairLancaster Great to connect Blair, and Thank You!When you fundamentally change the way in which you view yourself only then can you see others for Who They Truly Are.The vastness and multidimensionality of the soul is only veiled by the perception of this reality.One does not put out a fire with more fire just as one does not heal the separation with God with more denial.A chair is always stronger on four legs than three-everything is stronger when it is balanced and centered including you.There is no separation-only the illusion of it. #onenessGod works in the impossible-this is why divine intervention is often called a miracle.Your spiritual work is not to become complete, but remember your completeness. #onenessYou cannot enter into a new relationship with the same old expectations and attachments and expect a new experience.@naturopathmama @SimonHayHealer @DreamHomeYGK @GoGoPink1 @simpnutritionap @MagnumSolace @shoesbarrie Great to connect!We change the world by transforming ourselves. By shifting our consciousness from separation to oneness.You are a mini version of the Universe and like so, are too in the process of expanding your consciousness.@OANDorg Great to connect, and Many Thanks for the follow!At what point does humanity realize that the current level of consciousness is not working for them but against them?The ego has done an incredible job in convincing the masses that they are separate from Source Energy.It is the energy you carry-your vibrational frequency that has the greatest impact on others.Every experience begins with you. Positive or negative-you are deciding consciously or unconsciously what you see.@OfficerRod8037 Great to connect, and Many Thanks for the follow.@MagicOxygen @BobGilbertDC @WJGunning @garyjohnduncan @IWF @AmeMackenzie #GratitudeBe who you are, from the most authentic place-the Now.@SarahSchmermund Thank you, great to connect! Have a great weekend.The greatest gift you can offer to others is your present moment awareness.You can recreate yourself anew- there are no limits to consciousness.Every experience begins with you-what you offer to others is what is returned.You cannot enter into a new relationship with the same old expectations and attachments and expect a new experience.The Universe will use countless ways to get the message across...the question is who is paying attention?The act of forgiveness is a miracle because of its power to reverse feelings of hatred to return you to a place of peace.The soul-the essence that is you, is not interested in theory and conjecture but in direct experience with the All.@StoriaLockets Many Thanks for the RT!Spirituality and religion are two different things; the first is a way of being-direct experience and the latter is theory.The Mind of God cannot be divided-all is One.You can have an impact on others-not by trying to change them, but by raising your own vibrational frequency.Compassion comes from the understanding and knowing that every other human being is dealing with their own personal adversities.Be who you are, from the most authentic place-the Now.Governments talk about peace, they make plans for peace but peace without inner realization is only a fragment-a dream for peace.Your outlook on life is painted by the quality of your thoughts. Don't like what you've painted? Lay it aside and choose again.It is through stillness that you can look beyond appearances and see the essence of a human being-unconditional love.Massive shifts can take place when you change the smallest things-your thoughts.We change the world by transforming ourselves. By shifting our consciousness from separation to oneness.@KimberRinaldi Great to connect Kimberly, have a great week!Fulfillment doesn't really come from attainment but from emptying ourselves of that which no longer serves us.@teerain1 Great to connect Trish! Wishing you tremendous success in all that you do.@RealHighDiamond Excellent performance this morning, wishing you both much success!The soul is seeking one thing-to experience the Highest Version of Itself while still being with the body.The experiences we have, the emotions that are felt serve a purpose- to have us thirst for higher levels of consciousness.Forgive the past and you will not only heal it, but transform it.All that you think, say, do and even your vibrational frequency is a declaration of who you are.@ManagersDiary @LeadToday Many Thanks and have a great weekend.There is great strength in oneness.Love and fear are your two main choices- everything else is just a variation.@Canada_Website great to connect, have a wonderful weekend.Best wishes for your endeavour! If you can support @Dresses4_Prom in anyway please do.Kindness and compassion are both love in action.When you are in this space, it is you that is impacting your environment.Forgiveness that is extended through unconditional love remembers not the past-it only releases, frees you from guilt and anger.@arielleland Thank you for the follow Arielle, have a wonderful evening!@HoneymoonGondol Thank you as well!
