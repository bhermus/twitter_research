@InsiderFood Maybe feed the needy instead of this disgusting level of opulence.@NewYorker @msjennyxie @jennymxie Ugh. How did this even happen? Staffing issues?@juliacarriew I was just thinking the same thing when I saw the New Yorker mix up. Ugh. Not again...@CurbedSF Definitely that.@SFGiants Wow. How did he get a double on a hit to right field where nobody committed an error?@peterhartlaub You’re a kind man, peter.@mic @beardfoundation Lame if you consider who you see when you pop your head in any nice restaurant in NYC. the chefs and managers need to nurture and promote black, Hispanic and women chefs. The culinary school needs to push to add them to their ranks. Scholarships, etc@annielee415 By the way, I’m not even progressive. I’m a freaking San Francisco moderate.@staplesrusty @NJOwen @JaneKim @SFUnified @SFSunnita I like her too. Very accessible, articulate, bright and works harder than anybody that’s running. I’m super excited she’s running for mayor.@annielee415 I got something in the mail today that wasn’t pro anybody but merely anti Jane. It was so repugnant that I had to see who paid for it: lady conway. Forget it. That kind of ad strategy does not work for me. Go Jane!@markasaurus I’ve used it in other cities too. It’s awesome.@skip_sf @markasaurus @printtemps I like the 37 and a surprising number of people take it.@molly_knight Pat summit would have been pleased.@burritojustice I got a GE with a bottom freezer and the French doors. Fits all pizza boxes. Yo!@burritojustice This feels very portlandia.@burritojustice Cold drinks below freezing. What can go wrong?@audreycoopersf @JaneKim Kudos to you but instead of punting, I think the parties could have learned and strived to do better going forward. Journos are really good at helpful criticism and I believe that she could have stayed on with a fresh perspective of seeing the candidates more fairly after this.@KPIXtv Yay, us! 🙌🙌@KPIXtv @PlacerSheriff Lol. This looks like a photo from the onion.@hknightsf @peterhartlaub AND YES. MORE STREET CLEANING AND LESS LITTERING AND MORE 🚽!@hknightsf @peterhartlaub I love your article so much. I do love San Francisco with all of my heart and your story captured exactly the reason why. Thanks to all your readers for being a supporting cast member to a wonderful story that herb caen would have loved.

You’ve already made all your platform roofs red. And BART is already blue.@peterhartlaub Pete needs a hat...@ClaraJeffery We all knew this. The problem is the people that believe him are really lost to facts and reason at this point. It’s a cult and they need deprogramming.@burritojustice @BayAreaClipper Have you tried metrocards in nyc.

Are they on? Do they need 🚲 🚲🚲🚲? 🛴🛴🛴? Skateboards? That dorky round e-wheel that bros use? Segways? Unicycles?@sfchronicle @taraduggan @JustMrPhillips Thanks. A little more introspection by my hometown paper than that done by  my hometown reviewer, Michael Bauer. Time for accountability, Michael, no matter how big the star.@BoutrousTed @AshleyJudd Well done. Gutsy for Ashley for taking on a mogul so wonderful news! I’ve always liked her and wondered where she went. If only...@hknightsf @peterhartlaub Oh wow! I didn’t know Pete was related to Susan! Ps.

PERFECT.@mitchellreports @PressSec @margarettalev Can’t choose which part of the first amendment you want.@lucchesi @chrissyteigen @johnlegend I thought the same thing when I saw her tweet yesterday. She couldn’t have had an it’s-it to make that comment...@sfchronicle Maybe all the games should be free and make your money on concessions, parking and merchandise, @Athletics@anylaurie16 @ClaraJeffery Chelsea having an office and representing our country and her son in law as a top ranked WH staff member is also curious. So glad that bill is living hundreds of miles away and Hillary is spending every weekend meeting donors at her properties.@TimFlannery2 So corrupt. He’s been widely known so since the 80’s. To say lesser of two evils is to never bother to look into it yourself and fall for whatever bullshit Fox News tells you. No excuses. He’s a terrible man and an even more terrible leader.

Respect the animal that gave its life for you to eat.@keithlaw What a frickin racist moron.@factory1 Besides that person that hates to go to things, the republican dude is also missing.@thehill Good. Fuck off nazis.@MLNow Love it.@Jfredrix @nbcbayarea Was it? I read she was drunk. Maybe she passed out. :(@darth Yeah. I call bullshit.

They don’t give a shit about the Bay Area or what we want as a community. They take all our resources. Our houses, our water our towns and our cities and only have one goal: money and market domination.@richarddeitsch I thought he would get 4, maybe even 5.@TheRealWBTC @FitzTheReporter Makes you really appreciate journos bc mygod, they have 2 go 2 all these things &amp; somehow write about them. Truthfully, the last one I went to: alioto/Breed/kim are very similar. So it would be hard to write something that doesn’t sound repetitive. Good news: can’t go too wrong.@George_Aston_ @SFCityInsider @sfchronicle @ctuan Dude. They’re people. 😕@SFCityInsider @hknightsf @sfchronicle @ctuan If sf DPW wants to drive by in trucks with ice cream song blasting so we know you’re coming, we can toss them into the back of the truck in the area. #winwin@DenaliNPS Lol. Trump@TheRealWBTC @FitzTheReporter I even tried calling their campaign hq. London’s didn’t have anybody there to answer the phone and instead of vms, it said the person I was calling did not take voicemails. 🙄@TheRealWBTC @FitzTheReporter Yeah. That was the hardest part. So I ended up checking all their calendars on their websites to see my top 4-5 candidates. I didn’t find any other way. Back in the dark ages, the sf weekly/examiner/Chronicle/bay times etc had an event calendar 📆 that helped.@TheRealWBTC @FitzTheReporter I’ve been going to a bunch of debates &amp; learned a lot in terms of demeanor, policy &amp; getting a gd feel for genuineness. Personally, I think it takes a lot of effort to follow them around but it’s rlly rewarding in that I think I know who I’m voting for.
