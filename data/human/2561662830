https://t.co/LvgPvMCTVITime management takes practice and effort. The more you try to manage your time and dishes, the easier it gets. 

Prep work like cutting or blanching certain vegetables can be done in advance to save time. Not sure about managing everything at once? Start simple.- when timing the cook on your protein, factor in resting time. Less for thin, more for thick. 
- start cooking and time your vegetables to be finished when your protein is done resting. These usually cool the fastest! 
- make your plate look nice. We eat with your eyes firstKitchen tips:

Keep everything fresh and hot with proper timing. Follow an order of operations. 
- marinate protein or prep sauces in advance (optional)
- what will take the longest? Usually your starch unless you're making a roast or whole poultry.
