Asymmetry in knowledge between Europe to US vs vice versa is incredible@joelmcw You obviously haven't paid much attention to this issue. Maintaining the current frictionless border without NI (if not GB) being in CU is a non-runner. And Ireland trades most with EU26 (ex UK).

Brexit won't help, of course. English towns near National Parks have done a good job - we were very impressed by places like Brockenhurst near New Forest &amp; places in Yorkshire Dales.@TheRebelMC @MikeH_PR Fair enough. Reckon some folks from your tourist association should pay a visit to Dingle. That used to be fairly run down in the 1980s, but is now an amazingly vibrant place all year around. Maybe too many English seaside towns are still aiming at tourists from the 1980s?@TheRebelMC @MikeH_PR I appreciate that people live there. But they are not particularly attractive to contemporary tourists. There are plenty of grim resorts in Ireland too, but some of our smaller ones - e.g. Kinsale, Dingle, Westport - have reinvented themselves very effectively.@MicMacW Real concern is fall off in working age population and their unfunded public pensions schemes.@MikeH_PR They are mostly grim, to be honest from my visits to quite a few.
