I want bubble tea 😩Okay, I need to re-write some of my goals &amp; maybe add a few new ones..I also need a vacation.I wanna watch cartoons 🤷🏻‍♀️@inturgalactic YesAt this age you gotta realize everyone has a lot of growing to do, so you either grow together or outgrow each other.Never chase love. If it isn’t given freely, it’s worthless.Life has its way of catching up with us. Just be good and do good. You can’t cheat nature.Also... I’m feeling super blessed today.. ✨Looking at these 14 year olds in next to nothing clothing like wtf ?!??!A hard working man 👌🏽What’s done in the dark will always find a way to shineAll I want is McDonald’s fries ....This will probably be @inturgalactic and I. https://t.co/Coakr4gV25We need an actual smoke sesh..You’re looking like you like what you seeSo so so thankful for youSet goals so high that they demand an entirely different version of you.The more you find yourself, the more it’s clear who doesn’t belong in your life.Strangers will support you more than people you know because people that are close to you will have a hard time accepting that you come from the same place and yet they’re still in the same place.I think I’m fallen for youDon’t ever be afraid of darkness, sometimes the best inspiration comes from the darkest moments.Me: “guys, I really want a cheesecake”.

😂Keep your whole life low key and let people assume incorrectlyWho am I to hold your past against you  ..Once you put your pride aside you can notify me.Beauty is also about the way you move, speak and express yourself.@MissReginaa @Jollibee Omg saaaame!You know I’ve been gone for way too long, tell me “where you been, it’s been way too long”.I got all these faded memories of you, with me being faded with you.If we’re in the same house or the same building, you can’t interrupt a happy home then still build it...There’s nothing more important than going after what you love.Who knows where you’ll end up when that shit gets old.The good ones go, if you wait too longYou talk like you got what I needI can see your star shining down on meI pray that my daughters don’t get caught up with these lames and my sons never be one ..I can’t wait to go home and eatSoon as I get home to you ...If you ask the universe for signs, believe what shows up.Looking for truth? Observe people’s habitual behaviour, truth is in their patterns.. not so much their words.Learning to unlearn &amp; growing to outgrow.@IllzPut Ugh. Same... all the time 🤷🏻‍♀️I want bubble tea 🤦🏻‍♀️Sometimes you have to venture out of your world to find yourself.Once you find that person you wanna go to Ikea with.... that's it.You’re far from the usualHaving a low opinion of yourself is not modesty, it’s self-destruction.Didn’t know they drove Bentley’s in Oshawa ....I will flourish this year and no one can stop me.I’m not sure why I decided to watch this wedding video Cus now I’m crying... 🙄🙄🙄I want cheesecake 😩I’m not sure why I keep doing this to myselfFree fallinn@tonya_32 😩My eyebrow is so itchy and I can’t itch it .. what is lifeWhat a daaaayDon’t put your hand in the cookie jar, have some self control... cus everything that’s sweet ain’t good for you &amp; everything that glitters ain’t gold.Being in someone’s prayers is the purest form of real loveSomething sexy bout the way you smileI’ve become so obsessed with upgrading my life in every single aspect. I wanna be a better woman, all around.I just really hope that you think of me.... Cus I’m tryna be unforgettable“How you gonna get better with someone who doesn’t even measure up?”“Imma make you breakfast baby, cus going out is getting old”Be with someone who amplifies your peaceI hope you love yourself this Valentines Day. 💕You make me wanna put my phone down, when we’re alone I wanna zone out.You really can’t do anything to a woman who’s in love with herself.Personal growth becomes so addictive once you realize that it’s always possible to improve your experience of being.Happy February 1st ✨You ever stopped and thought “wow, I prayed for this. It’s here. It’s happening” ..https://t.co/NA92jpsqzEBe consistent in maintaining an aura of grace and love.The woman you are becoming will cost you people, relationships, spaces and material things. Choose her over everything.I don’t have anything to wear 😩I need like a million more clothes ....Have a great day guys ✨Time always exposes what you mean to someoneI remember when I used to ask my friend to bring me coffee all the time... and now he’s my boyfriend..... coffee is the key to literally anything...I really just wanna put a dress onIts #nationalpieday ... @inturgalacticCan it be summer already plsss 🌻Speak it into existence and trust the processWhen it rains it poursOrange juice is life ... 👅👅Surround yourself with people who posses the ability to calm you with their presence alone.P.s people don’t deserve to be in your life by default. You don’t have to tolerate those who mistreat you.Fresh flowers plsss 💐🌸🌼🌷🌹🌻🌺Me: **scared af** tells boyfriend why I’m scared**
