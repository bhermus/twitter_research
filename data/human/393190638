Cops lives matter too.If anyone who is carrying a weapon, and feel as if their life is threatened, they will retaliate use deadly force.A police officer is there is uphold and enforce the law. People tend to forget that.Just seen a video where a Memphis police officer was jumped by a group of thugs, but yet people say a cop shouldn't shoot?

I can listen to Justin beiber without anyone judging me. I love itThe key to farting in public is you can blame it on everybody.That's awkward moment when you and the guy in the bathroom stall are whistling the same song.Anytime someone says "I'm in between jobs.." It means they are unemployed.I can't stand being somewhere in public and parents don't have control over their kids.It's so crazy that you see people out and about in town, and you later found out that they've been arrested for selling meth. Wow, smh.Just seen someone with a bumper sticker that said "thank god for obamacare". Wow, I hate sorry asses.Got a grilled Chicken Salad from crossroads grill.
