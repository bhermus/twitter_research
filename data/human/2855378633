Not only hugely out of step with public opinion, but also discredited research which seeks to stigmatise women. #choice  https://t.co/dtbNKglzpiüò° https://t.co/RWOkWukvL0The anti choicers are now spreading their messages of hate and misinformation outside schools üò° Glad to see @GlasgowCC have taken them down. #choice https://t.co/Y7d9Rn43J3Good article in today‚Äôs Sunday Times setting out the clear absurdities in SPUC‚Äôs legal challenge to the taking of misoprostal at home. #choice  https://t.co/xUKP8pwcq7In response to SPUC legal action against @scotgov decision to allow misoprostal to be taken at home please see letter from EXPERTS in the field supporting the decision. #prochoice  https://t.co/zJlP09kureYup!  https://t.co/SZyeyWCx8sThe Big Ask -  Help us win the pro-choice fight.

It‚Äôs a sticking plaster.

The gestational limits and procedures also vary at different Health Boards within Scotland.Hope Scottish Government follow suit.

The Scottish women travelling for late abortions was mentioned in our first set of tweets.@jojoscott71 @citzgirl @ClareBaileyGPNI @NicolaSturgeon @patrickharvie 2/2 this procedure is not provided on the NHS in Scotland. Last year 180 women had to travel. It is a scandal.@jojoscott71 @citzgirl @ClareBaileyGPNI @NicolaSturgeon @patrickharvie 1/2 The study is quite clear: ‚ÄòWomen who request a termination after 18‚Äì20 weeks must travel to England to obtain the abortion‚Äô.@iclare1 @gille_toine @NicolaSturgeon @ScotParl Yes. Only 2 Health Boards we are aware of pay travel expenses in advance. The limits across Health Boards are a bit of a postcode lottery.@gille_toine @iclare1 @NicolaSturgeon @ScotParl Unfortunately, the Scottish Government did not advise us of this change and did not mention it in their comment to the Herald story.@Fagashlil76 We support all actions which would extend women‚Äôs right to chose. The 2 Doctors signature is outdated, paternalistic &amp; serves no purpose.@gille_toine @NicolaSturgeon @ScotParl Please see study: https://t.co/KQ3p1YKhKh - also different gestational limits for different health boards.@citzgirl @ClareBaileyGPNI @NicolaSturgeon @patrickharvie Most women over 18 weeks gestation.
