@David_Cormack That's your breakfast sorted...@richardhills777 @AklTransport @TransportBlog I know.... I've seen the vids....Awful. Thanks for your support üòä@richardhills777 @AklTransport @TransportBlog All the cones have gone so it looks like it's finished. Zebra crossing badly needed - the bump is low and motorists barely slow down üò£@AklTransport Any chance of someone coming with a pot of paint to finish the ped crossing outside Billy's, Queen St, Northcote? A bump does not replace a zebra crossing. @TransportBlog @richardhills777@BikeAKL Civil unrest, that's what we need. Wasn't High St lovely today? üòç@richardhills777 @BenRoss_AKL  https://t.co/clzDiRVTVfRest of the world moves away from cars, twds PT. @TgaCouncil votes for a 9 storey carpark.

Not good for the bus. Please send enforcement officer. Thks.@MidlifeChic OMG you rock that dress. Bet you caused a crash crossing the road üòÄ@tina_plunkett @BenRoss_AKL Yep. Splitting the red/green vote will achieve nothing good -the greens have zero chance of winning the seat but still will make it really difficult for Shannan to win.

Even my bus driver stopped to tell your officer off this morning.  @GreaterAKL@RichardjAshurst @simonbwilson @AklTransport Onewa Rd really needs to be a bus lane with fixed cameras. The level of infringement is shocking.@richardhills777  do you know if iwi are looking at a rahui on the various bush areas in Kaipatiki? Focus has been on Waitakere but lots of mighty kauri in BH/Birk/Bkdale - would be a pity to close the walks, but surely the trees must be at risk? thks for your great work :-)@AklTransport And thanks for the people who need to stop at those stops to get a connection.

In AKL some centres have a 2 year waiting list lol.@David_Cormack Don‚Äôt want to freak you out but if you and Kim are going to need a daycare centre for Bub now is a good time to start enquiring. The good ones have almighty waiting lists....@SamSachdevaNZ Yes, you are in transit. I have checked my current Esta and it was for transit to another country.
