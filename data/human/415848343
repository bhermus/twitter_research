He was like "it's Cinco De Mayo, how do they not have specials". I swear I was about to go off. Some people really need to be educated.I swear this morning was too much. And I had to miss work, but everything is now up to dateCame back home from work at 1am tonight and my mom had Pozole ready for me.

I love watching the show but it's not going to be the same. It's not gonna show the improvement of the athletes like you seen on other seasons. Plus it's a bit weird.@romo_gabs It does suck.
