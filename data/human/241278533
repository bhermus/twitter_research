Finn Balor
Owens/Zayn
Asuka 
Triple H/Stephanie
AJ Styles
Roman Reigns@sassypants81 Or the Resident Evil series (especially RE5) where you can have a handgun, crossbow, and grenade launcher in your pack like it's no big deal https://t.co/AlJcUkL7RVNot really sure how I feel about #TruthOrDare yet, but I definitely like what I've seen of #AQuietPlaceAbout to wrap up season two of #YoungJustice on #netflix 🤓Most definitely enjoyed the ending to #SDLive this week 👌🏼@mfoster778 I'm pumped for #WrestleMania , just don't get a few of the story lines/matches 🤷🏻‍♂️Based on work I'll be saving #SDLive for tomorrow, hopefully they can do a better job at hyping their matches, gotta say Adding Rusev to the triple threat for the US title took some of the appeal off for me.. 🤷🏻‍♂️ #WWE #wrestlemaniaThis whole circus surrounding Strowman's tag partner is blah at best.. The Undertaker leaving Cena and the fans hanging like that is BOGUS .. I sure hope the mixed tag featuring RRR is early during the PPV as I have ZERO interest in it.. 🤷🏻‍♂️ #RAW #WWE #WrestleManiaWow... Balor vs Rollins #RawI feel like I'm 32 going on 65, with that said #RAW is will check you in the AM! https://t.co/7xjLprFqky@sassypants81 All good then? Probably just needed a Man sized yet self-imposed time out, we do that sometimes https://t.co/TW9tpTzIRF@SportsCenter My bracket is already a dumpster fire, but for what it's worth I picked #Villanova to win it all. https://t.co/j3Io9of4hv@sassypants81 Ugh, some lemons are late bloomers .. https://t.co/dz9zfvE7cr"Well...Well.."- said in my most maleficent voice 😱 https://t.co/br6kxAF85iHmmm 🤨🤔🤓 https://t.co/WoFCjZdaOLCool, I think I pulled the plug on Mad Max too early when I owned it for Xbox One. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤓 https://t.co/d1b4hJBew9@alisa_cassie you really should be giving Twitter another go... https://t.co/uUsubpTCvX@TeeDotYankee I love me some OBJ, but I think a change of scenery will help him. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️I've been waiting for this.. 🤓💯🔥 https://t.co/OjQsi28Gh0It's almost #FantasyFootball prep time!! https://t.co/FasbMoZPDCWith my #FantasyHockey season winding down I have to say here's my Plus/Minus for the season:

Plus
Brad Marchand

My picks to win
Torn between Sasha Banks and Natalya

Sleeper pick : Bailey over Banks to add to the "beef" that's been buildingWell after seeing it on #SDLive , add the triple threat match of Orton vs Roode vs Mahal for the United States title to my list of matches I'm hype for at #WrestleMania34What a match!! Charlotte vs Natalya was 🔥🔥 that power bomb and then that superplex from the top rope 😲 #SmackdownLiveMan, that spinning power bomb on Charlotte has me 😲 #SmackDownLIVE#WrestleMania34 matches I'm looking forward to

The Miz vs Rollins vs Balor
Charlotte vs Asuka 
Reigns vs Lesnar 
Styles vs Nakamura@WWEDanielBryan YES! YES! YES! YES!I've recently paved my own path to #WrestleMania34 ... LOL #WWE2K18 #SethRollins #JinderMahal #FinnBalor https://t.co/iyqmg9dSvp@Jsquyres33 Let me know what you think@TeeDotYankee I enjoy it, BUT it is such a commitment compared to Fantasy football and Hockey for me as I'm NEVER "that guy" by not staying active within the league and keeping on top of my rosterCatching up on #SmackDownLIVE .. #danielbryan !!!!! So FREAKIN AwesomeSo yet another odd ending to #RAW ... I'm glad the "ultimate deletion" is over though 🙏🏼@DennisConnoll14 https://t.co/0B4Dqqe8EX@Rajio @PlayOverwatch Assassin's Creed Origins man, a great play along with a solid break from the rigger of online MP 👌🏼🤓@SuperheroSteel Trailer 2 as it shows more of the overall scope.. the Avengers are going to be in tough vs Thanos and there's potential of some major characters being killed off..@CaptainGalxy I'm so worried for the Avengers, Thanos is one of my all time favorite Supper Villians so I know there's going to be some heroes Crossed off... 😬🤓@mfoster778 @mrfrancis09 @Crimson_Gorilla @pyer2902 @DennisConnoll14 @robaire22 I'm geeking HARD right now, can't wait for April 27th@Gamer_Fudo23  https://t.co/K3wb0ZIuhvNew #InfinityWar trailer has me https://t.co/3GYnj31C4z@mrfrancis09 @mfoster778 @Crimson_Gorilla @pyer2902 @DennisConnoll14 @robaire22 OMFG!!! https://t.co/PdSuuwBr1g@gameinformer Can't wait to KO/TKO Dana... I wonder how many fighters on the UFC brand will do the same!?I can dig it https://t.co/3I99AKXtbcTotally see a triple threat match for the United States championship being added to #Wrestlemania ...@Ravens Definitely not the haul I was hoping for, looks like another season of potentially lumbering up the field on offense 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️GLORIOUS!!!! - Bobby Roode https://t.co/ua44xrdqyZSo I finished my #MarchMadness2018 bracket... Ugh, now we wait.. https://t.co/pyqEU1a18e@TeeDotYankee MAN that guy drives me nuts!! #GoSitDownAlreadyGetting caught up on this week's #SmackdownLive ...
