Oh man! I didn't think this was going to be dropped on me today. Wow! https://t.co/HcwiUOudi4@Jack_Not_John side eye emoji times a billion https://t.co/1ueqZvmU1NIt's sucks that they lost but there's a lot to be excited about with this team for next year. #NHLBruinsGleyber goes boom!!!! #Yankees@CENZO26 ExactlyIt never ceases to amaze me that some of these guys driving 53 footers have no fucking clue how to drive 53 footers@RogerMarceau @CENZO26 Let's not forget Turbo dancing up the wall@CENZO26 a couple of years later Shabadoo saved the rec center! https://t.co/nzttgevmGQ@Jack_Not_John Maybe I am!@Jack_Not_John I wasn't prepared for this today. I need to lie down now https://t.co/zzOSCqH0Oq@RogerMarceau A bunch of #Wrongies and some #WrongTimes @Dj_U_neek@Jack_Not_John Jeter would have dressed up as Cap https://t.co/OGisBkAlu8Or it's called being smart. https://t.co/AkQxjkLlAa@JennaMarchant Let's be honest tho, the B's should have been a primetime game. The scrubini teams should play at 3 on Saturday. Fact@JennaMarchant Bought these tickets 5 weeks ago. I watch every period of every game. Have to see the big movies before anyone ruins themAll of you nasty bastards that don't wash your hands after using the restroom at the movies are savage farm animalsWOW! #AvengersInfinityWar I need to lie down now...@nickcafardo that's why your article was laugh out loud funny. Both are these players are very good, borderline great, but nowhere near Mike Trout. That "gap" might as well be the Grand Canyon. https://t.co/rU8Pu4vwQIOutstanding tribute to Bruno Sammartino by the @WWE It got a little dusty in here. #ItalianHero #BrunoIsUno #TheLivingLegend@Jack_Not_John "I came as soon as I heard someone ruffling a plastic bag!" -my dog https://t.co/Sn2d0Q5DQKAmazing! https://t.co/Grp7tRwniSBooooooooooooo! https://t.co/p10gcNDztRGil Santos will not be coming down for breakfast#1 Paul Jones not coming down for breakfast and I guess his 100 year feud with the Boogie Woogie Man Jimmy Valiant is now over.Stoooooopppppppppppp https://t.co/9FUjfFVkifNo he's not. Just stop https://t.co/uZ7O00l4HzThe Living Legend Bruno Sammartino is busy selling out the arena in Heaven and won't make it down for breakfast. Rest in power.  #BrunoIsUnoStop! Trout is a generational talent. He's this generation's Mantle, Griffey or Bonds. As good as Betts is, there is no comparison. Betts isn't even close. This isn't even a debate. https://t.co/RvDpiSxgP6The goodest boy. Also this pic is NSFW https://t.co/gCqcBQJSpABarbara Bush not coming down for breakfast. Rest in powerThis is spectacular. This guy gets it, right @Jack_Not_John? https://t.co/l1OFhCcojUJudge Harry T. Stone will not be coming down for breakfast.@RogerMarceau As a fan I think the roster spot is more important at this point. Cashman fell for the banana in the tail pipe because of his obsession with Ellsbury. The guy probably juiced that one season and has fallen apart since.Ellsbury with his third, I said third,  injury of the year. Honestly just cut bait with this stiff at this point. Even if, huge if, he can come back and play a little no one will take him or should I say take any money in a trade in the off-season. Pay him to leave. #YankeesShoot this guy into the moon. https://t.co/1kbICjLYFnIf you are the person whose job it is to clean these bathrooms, you quit at the site of this, right? https://t.co/Rs9V4sZ1M0R.

It's nice when my guys who have moved on to bigger and better things come by to say hello... right @Dj_U_neek @rmastro17 and @DMazz24?It sure as hell beats watching Jeter and Ortiz playing grab ass in the middle of the field. #Yankees@Jack_Not_John look at this doggo. #Adorbs https://t.co/VnnzzwxDrwWhat a terrible person. Just an awful take. She must be a real ray of sunshine to be around. https://t.co/hm72qAVqPEThis is great https://t.co/IbxkscKifj@RogerMarceau That's a big old no@CENZO26 Love that stickHere you go boys, she's an oldie but a goodie.

I will tell you this, you have a store wide problem in most of your locations with the way people in different departments answer phone. 99.9% of the customer service desk are great. The rest, not so much.Ooohhh @StopandShop you have some tough guys answering phones in some of your department. Sounds like you have to retrain some of them on how to speak to people.#TheShredder is more accurate than not but Didi is a top 5 or 6 shortstop. Huge miss by #TheShredder https://t.co/SZMkJwkhKt@Jack_Not_John this will turn your friend upside down https://t.co/vLbXiqdaDfLuscious Johnny Valiant is not coming down for breakfast.Good luck against this lineup, MLB! #YankeesSir Didi!!! #YankeesAnd when you get there, go further away! https://t.co/njhhRPniH5@L_Motts @RogerMarceau @JohnCena @ReginaPizzeria And his mom always fed us when we delivered slush!@L_Motts @RogerMarceau @JohnCena @ReginaPizzeria I knew where to go for ice cream in West Newbury, JC's!@RogerMarceau @JohnCena @ReginaPizzeria C'mon thoooGood review but kind of messed up @JohnCena couldn't rattle off his favorite Boston pizza which probably should be @ReginaPizzeria https://t.co/8jVHFrSUKsI wish I could like this a million times!!! https://t.co/jUzLCIRxwN@MikeyColdcuts At the same time fox has never been objective. When their top personalities are using the terms "the left" and "the deep state" they are giving their opinions instead of stating facts. That's not fair and balanced, as they claim they are. It is what it isMaybe they should stop doing these spots. Yikes! https://t.co/FZrBEq4SSM@Jack_Not_John I guess you could say she ghosted you for your pizza@Jack_Not_John She cucked you for your pizza@MikeyColdcuts CNN isn't perfect either. Both channels are focused on each outher like WWE and WCW and not reporting the news.@MikeyColdcuts I'm neither right nor left but I did go to school and majored in journalism. Fox news is a small step up from tabloid journalism. From their everything that doesn't agree with their agenda is "fake news" or their ridiculous conspiracy theories like the "deep state".@L_Motts @Dj_U_neek @Jack_Not_John I'm not going to name names but I work with a guy and a girl who told me Donato was overrated when he was in high school tearing it up. But I'm pretty sure there was a lot of jealousy coming from those two that he was better than their kids. It happens.@Dj_U_neek @Jack_Not_John Some kids are scoring NHL goals like Ryan Donato and some kids, who's father said Donato was a little overrated, are busy vaping in the parking lot.@MariMarchant I'm gonna pinch his cheeks!It's funny on this "fair and balanced" "news" station, when one of these wack jobs go too far and the advertisers start leaving, the "journalist" usually get a few days off. Most of this channel brings shame to the profession of journalism. https://t.co/0ZdM9ntTyh@MariMarchant @Dj_U_neek I like cookies...@MLBTV hey your app hasn't been working for a few days. Can't open it on my phone or my TVShe's just an awful human being https://t.co/12HBWFcbsGYeauup, Stanton can stay. #YankeesStanton!!!!! #Yankees@tiffany_56 Can you dip their pacifier in liquor?

Can you say triggered? #FairAndBalanced https://t.co/cjhm28IYi4I think they should be good with the rest of the team that hit 240 home runs and oh yeah they also acquired Giancarlo Stanton. So yeah, they should be fine until he gets back and is 100%. https://t.co/vJM9aX2jpZHey @Jack_Not_John you know how I needed to hear this. Even though it takes place in the 90s there is still hope he is also in Avengers 4 https://t.co/jMU3ZmPTWPHe might need a bath in some holy water https://t.co/1TDKuWNbJh"You remind me of my daughter" That's a weirdo pick up line coming from billionaire. Honestly he probably should have just said,  "Hey, I'm a billionaire, does that turn you on?" But this Orange Goblin Cheeto had to make it super weird.If overrated means there are only two or three other shortstops you would take over him, Correa/Lindor/Seager, then yeah he's super overrated. https://t.co/Dj24vrNQsU@Dj_U_neek @rmastro17 Well, four of those emojis clearly indicate that he is thinking super hard.RAAAAAHHHHH https://t.co/PPfqawrPCL@Jack_Not_John Do you want to go do karate in the garage?@Jack_Not_John There's one outside my window right now too.

Hey @CENZO26 @Dj_U_neek and @Jack_Not_John I remember @tomm588 and his buddy telling me a couple of years ago when he was drafted that he was a little overrated. I knew there was a lot of jealousy in the room during that conversation.@CENZO26 @Dj_U_neek @Jack_Not_John Wow, he must be pretty good to go right to the Bruins like that. https://t.co/Rr1SQylZeQ@BarstoolHubbs You did it wrong.
