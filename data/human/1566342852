Happy birthday @adamlambert!! I love you and hope your day is amazing. ❤️@adamlambert Ever been deep sea fishing?@adamlambert Favorite reality TV show of all time?@adamlambert There’s a phrase “dogs are like potato chips, you can’t just have one.” Is that true for you? Is Pharaoh getting a brother or sister anytime soon?@adamlambert Aftermath because it’s such a powerful and moving song. It really shows your voice.Adam Lambert is one hot tamale. He's talented, sweet and the whole package. 😍Though I don't get on Twitter as much as I would like, I still adore each and every one of you especially Adam. 😍@AmericanIdol Indianapolis!@adamlambert @OfficialRMT Happy birthday Roger! Y'all were amazing in Cleveland. Thank you for the great experience. ❤️❤️Talk to Siri and say "I see a little silhouetto of a man." You won't be disappointed. Siri knows what good music is. 💁🏼Adam Lambert by like 1000x https://t.co/2xl3Z3AI2Z@becksie1 @adamlambert He's so beautiful. 😍@Fanadama @adamlambert @QueenWillRock Thank you!@Fanadama @adamlambert @QueenWillRock Do you care if I post this on my Facebook? I'll give credit. :)At Cleveland Adam was talking about Frank (the robot from News of the World) and he said that frank gave good head as he was lifted up. 😂😂😂@lambertsroyalty I was when I got there! It's so much to take in, you'll have a blast!@highkingelliott @adamlambert @QueenWillRock Your friend seems awesome! I definitely noticed it too! Fell in love and thought "how can I get one?!?" Haha@highkingelliott @adamlambert @QueenWillRock I saw you last night in the crowd and told my mom how much I loved your crown! What a small world to actually find you on twitter! :)Hey @adamlambert I fucking love you. :)To you, I'm really sorry. I've changed and I don't like who I used to be.I remember being carefree and always on twitter knowing about what Adam was doing, etc. I don't miss being an ass though. If I was ever rude@ChloeDeCucumber This is so relatable. Leather pants always made me think very naughty things about him at 14 and I'm 17 now so it's more acceptable. 😂😂He's so cute! I just wanna go back to the concert. It was the best night of my life. @adamlambert definitely does not disappoint. https://t.co/fVrbDwtEv4OMG HE'S SO FUCKING CUTE. Is it bad I wish he'd have done that before Cleveland? His hair matched the lights in almost all pics I got. 😜😂 https://t.co/hAVMHOr4nCPlus there's something about a ginger, black haired or brown headed Adam Lambert that is just 🔥🔥I mean the red grew on me but my pictures weren't very good because the red hair blended in with the set.You mean to tell me I was hoping for Adam to go back to brown for the concert just for him to do it after my concert? 😐😂@129aquarius I'm not always either but you're very kind and I'm thankful for that. ❤️❤️I love Glamberts and how close we can get in just a few minutes. The majority of us are amazing. @129aquarius is such an angel.@lohablondie @14gelly He's such an angel. They all are really.@BeatsOfLambert I want him to be in a relationship with me. Lmao. I agree with everything you've said though. He's an angel. 💕Being private on twitter is so difficult. I'm done. Lmao@FallBackIntoMe Sorry for your loss. 💕@BTRNadja @adamlambert Well then I need a replica. 😩😂@_sketcher @adamlambert AMAZING!@BTRNadja @adamlambert I want your shirt. OMGAdam is a precious angel that we must protect at all cost.@129aquarius I wish I could RT this 1000xWhen my nephew is with me I'm going to play Queen and Adam music so he knows what good music is. 🤷🏼‍♀️@14gelly Did she just grab him and yank him in? I wondered why he looked back when I saw him yesterday. I was 6 rows where the guitar body juts out.@ariesleto Rough? This looks fucking amazing@lambertsroyalty Back which sucks because I thought it did. The poster I got has wrinkles in it too. Best day of my life though. You'll have a blast.@lambertsroyalty Just a warning shirts are $40 and posters of him are $25. I got a poster and shirt. The red white and blue ones don't have tour dates on..WHO ELSE WAS AT QAL CLEVELAND?!?@idklambert You're so pretty Natalie. 😩@lambertsroyalty YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN! I saw him at Cleveland and now I'm super depressed cause I just wanna see him again! It was AMAZING.@becksie1 @adamlambert You were there too?!?HOLY SHIT. ADAM WAS SO CUTE AND IM SUPER DEPRESSED IM NOT STILL AT THE CONCERT.Adam is a fucking babe. I can't wait to see him in July. 😩🔥@adamlambert @FlauntMagazine @justinrcampbell @NicoKlam DAYUMMMMLong time no see everyone. I have no idea why I do this to myself. 😂😂Can't wait to see Adam and Queen in July. 😩@judadam I'm going to try being a private account for awhile to see what happens. I'd hate to leave.@adamismyqueen It really sucks though because I want people to be able to retweet me or whatever but o don't want my family to find me. 😭Okay so I've changed my username and put my privacy to protected. Hopefully they won't find me. Fingers crossed. 😩@judadam No they do but they don't know I cuss or have inappropriate thoughts. Lol. They think I'm more innocent than I really am. 😂@ShadyGlitter My cousin and uncle's girlfriend found my Instagram and I had my user and everything on it so I hurried up and deleted it. LolI might be deleting this account so just a heads up. I don't really want to but I'm rarely on it plus I don't want my family to know.@adamismyqueen what I talk about so I did that. If they knew then I'd get in so much trouble. 😩For anyone wondering, I deleted my Instagram and changed my username on here. My family found my Instagram and I don't want them to know....@adamlambert Happy Birthday! Hope your day is as fantastic as you are. ❤😘@TheOrigFRODO My heart. 😍❤@CoCoNUTZ4ADAM My life is complete. ❤😍So Adam adopted Pharoah? Please say yes because I always hoped he would and MY HEART. 😭❤️@TheOrigFRODO I'm glad they are. I didn't join the fandom until after Sauli and him had broken up so I don't know much. LolI'm so confused. Are Adam and Saudi back together? I feel like I've been gone for a million years.@LambQuest I hope so. I was bummed when they didn't come to Indiana@oliviarose567 *For anyone wondering... I call dogs puppies even if they're  full grown. 😂😂Whose puppy was Adam walking?@ratchetbert No need to thank me, I'm literally just stating the truth. But seriously, can I be you for awhile?!@ratchetbert OMG. You're so pretty.@ShadyGlitter a picture from 2009 but said he was 34 and engaged. 😂@ShadyGlitter Rams is that you? Haha. And I was laughing so hard when I read this. I saw that they updated that it was false but they usedSomebody please comment on this. I'm literally dying. I don't even know how to respond to this article about Adam. 😂😂What the hell did I just read? 😂😂
https://t.co/88x0K5YKt0@LambQuest I think Freddie would love that Adam is singing his songs and allowing the generation to hear his music.@LambQuest Yes but a CD with him singing would still be good. He did tour with them@akalexander5050 We know what good music is, let's just say that. Lol@LambQuest That's fine as long as I get an album that has Adam singing their music.I want a Queen or Q+AL shirt for Christmas! 😩May or may not have been in Walmart &amp; noticed that there were no TOH CDs &amp; then after finding one I may or may not have put it in front. 🙄@LambQuest Yeah but I wouldn't be able to play that in the car. :(@shoshannastone You wanna spill?@sararoselambert True, true. It hurts my heart that I'll never be his though. 😩😭😂@sararoselambert Mmm hmmm. Probably more pervy than they should be right now. He turns me on though. 😂😂@sararoselambert Mmmm hmmm. Maybe I could make it come true with tequila and a full moon. 😏🤔@sararoselambert up*@sararoselambert 😂😂 Seriously though. I have that dream and when I wake up I'm like WTF. I secretly want that to happen. I'm fucked it. 😂@sararoselambert Let's just say me and him were having fun. LolHad an amazing dream about me and Adam... Then I woke up. 😩😒@LambQuest Plus Adam has the voice of an angel. A sexy as fuck angel but still an angel. Haha@LambQuest I know he's not part of the original band. Lol. He'd be in his 60's if he was. I just want a Q+AL album because I never saw them.Have you ever written something but then deleted it because you know that people won't reply or that nobody cares?@LambQuest I hope that's not true! I need a Q+AL CD! 😭I'm voting @adamlambert for president 2020. If Kanye can run then so can Adam. #AdamForPresident2020Please tell me that the new Queen album has Adam singing. PLEASE. 😩Well fellow Americans... You fucked us all. Thank you very much.@adamlambert Can you be president for 2020? I'll vote for you! #AdamForPresident2020Ugh. He won, now I bet he'll get assassinated faster than JFK did. 🤔@idklambert Thank you. Much appreciated, on the other hand is he is elected, he'll probably be killed faster than JFK. 😂😂@lillyblillyan I'm taking that as a yes. https://t.co/LKZGbJ58RvI want to meet Adam so bad. Hopefully he comes to Indiana for his next album but I doubt it because Indiana sucks. 😂😂Did anyone even notice I said as gone? Lmao. My notifications are dry af. 😂😂Hey @lillyblillyan I'm back. Did ya miss me? 😏Hey @adamlambert if you want to drop a new album tomorrow, I'd totally be cool with that.I feel like I've been gone for centuries. 😂😂@adamsglamberrt  What did it say? It won't come up.What's new with Adam? I've been gone for like 2 months because computer broke.I have a dig bick.
^Lets see how many people actually read that wrong. 😂😂I haven't been on in forever. I barely had anything in my notifications so it's all good. 😂😂@shuboogie  but I still cuss and believe in equal rights for all. The church doesn't. Whoops. 😂😂 I love OITNB though. It's my favorite!@shuboogie Haha. I wish it was that easy. I have a very Christian family, I'm Christian but I have different views than the church...@shuboogie I LOVE THAT SHOW! It's my favorite. Parents don't know I watch it though. Mom would think I'm gay or bi if I told her (straight).@adamlambert @StephanieJBlock @OITNB You watch OITNB?!? YASSSS. I LOVE IT AND YOU. &lt;3WHAT THE FUCK? POUSSEY IS DEAD?!? DAMN. I hate it when shows kill some of my favorite people off. #OITNBWhat tf is going on with Adam? People are pissed at him from what I hear? What went down?On one of Ruby's pictures on Facebook someone said she was Leo+Angelina Jolie and someone else said she's part Adam. I'M SCREAMING.@oliviarose567 I'll take this as I'm the only one. :pI vote #PiperAndStella not #Vauseman. Whoops.@RubyRose is fucking sexy and I'm a straight woman. How on earth is this even possible?I'm straight but I'd make out with Ruby Rose's face. Surely I'm not the only straight one that feels this way? I mean she's a babe.Uggghhhh. I wanna watch OITNB! :(@oliviarose567 It's torturing me knowing what goes on past episode 2. I can't even sleep. I waited all day for OITNB and only watched 2 ep.@oliviarose567 My parents wouldn't approve of me watching it but it's so good. My sister uses our Netflix even though she doesn't live w/ usI wanna watch OITNB so fucking bad but I have to wait for my sister to watch episodes and wait until she goes to bed and then watch them.#WeStandWithAdamLambert
