I just fucking hate Gregg Williams , like you hate wind@NickInMentor Was a mistake keeping them, but considering Haslam‚Äôs past he was screwed. I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre gone next year, barring some unforeseen success@NickInMentor I agree, I love Tyrod. I just despise this coaching staff but who knows, maybe I‚Äôll be surprised@NickInMentor I only thought corner would be huge need in FAI feel like Gregg clearly impacts that in a negative way. That was/is my point@NickInMentor I have no issue with what they have done, but I think they are missing on people who don‚Äôt want to play for this staff. Particularlly on defense@NickInMentor My comment was Gregg is shit, sorry to upset you@NickInMentor Right, because Gregg Williams is a shit coachWhen your best isn‚Äôt good enough that‚Äôs still called failure https://t.co/v9AYbxxnAa@MarkSkog @BlueMike5577 Rosen seems clearly to be the guy, this shouldn‚Äôt be that hard. They will fuck it up I‚Äôm sure.@MarkSkog @BlueMike5577 I mean I get upside but he averaged two turnovers a game, plus I have zero faith in this staff to develop anyone let alone a qb@MarkSkog @BlueMike5577 Hue will fix it! üòîüî´Im not pro Sashi, but 1-31 is a stain on this bullshit coaching staff. From player development to game day Hue/Gregg are fucking garbage.@SeanPullins I do miss 240 yds and 1 td a yearSurprised corners aren‚Äôt jumping to play for a guy who makes them call him daddy and constantly line ten yards off the WRDidn‚Äôt Trumaine hate Gregg?
