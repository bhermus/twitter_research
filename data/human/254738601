Is there anything better than a Monday morning when you're not in work?! Have a fabulous Bank Holiday everyone ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️@mileswithshell @runr_uk Lovely ☺️ Might have to copy your idea with my boys. I'd love to find one of these, just gives you a little lift doesn't it?! x@mileswithshell @runr_uk That sounds like a fab idea! What did you put on the other ones?@vickitoria35 Know what you mean. It soon comes back to you doesn't it ☺️ I ran at 8.30 but it didn't get out sunny and warm really until about 11 so I caught it at the right time! Couldn't run now 😬 Having a good weekend I hope?@vickitoria35 Thanks! Well done to you on your c25k!! 🎉Got a watch pb yesterday on 5k and fastest mile, got a new fastest mile today, but 5k was 1 second slower grrr 🙄Gorgeous day ☀️ 3rd run in 3 days done early doors #MilesForMind and bbq for tea. This is the life 👌🏻 #BankHolidayWeekend@leemeadofficial Same!! Have a great one xHad a brilliant day, although ridiculously busy! Finished my Higher orals, amazing students 😍 Worked on the Prom &amp; came home to do another 4 miles for #MilesForMind then hiit and a walk. Next stop...chinese 😋😁 #happybunny Happy Weekend all!! xBetter late than never, but 5 miles in the bank for #MilesForMind @runr 😊🏃🏻‍♀️@lakeslass Definitely!!! 😍@vickitoria35 It is a good one. Builds up slowly and has rest days too! Might be good for you getting back into a bit of exercise xx@vickitoria35 Love this!!! My boys were joining in with me when I was doing the app the other day 😂 it's called sth like 'lose weight in 30 days' no idea how I came across it but it's fab. Shows you how to do it!@vickitoria35 Haha 😂😂 Know that feeling well!!! I've got a rough idea of what I'm doing, keeping the first part of hols as a bit of catch up time if needed!! I've just started an exercise app, really good and feeling the difference after only a fortnight. 10 mins a day 👍🏻@vickitoria35 @runr_uk Yay!!! Nice work 👍🏻 How did it feel? I'm just a bit worried I won't have the time to do it, just need to get out the door really. Got all my pathetic excuses lined up 😂Psyching myself up for the start of my @runr_uk #MilesForMind May challenge!! 100 miles. Let's do this!! 👍🏻🏃🏻‍♀️😀Had a great day with the boys yesterday in the sunshine, tried to continue today...went to skate park &amp; swings...now hailstones?! 🤔🌫️ #weirdweather@jasedurr Wow!! I'm actually jealous of your curls!!@vickitoria35 Awww 😍 so cute!!@marathon_sam I say, go for it! Whatever makes you comfy 👍🏻@vickitoria35 Oh no, hope you're ok and not too shaken or annoyed!!! xx@janbaker97 Excellent! Keep it up!@janbaker97 Hope you're following your own advice!! 😉 x@ClairefontUK Ohhh I love @ClairefontUK notebooks!!

Fingers crossed this one does the job 🤞🏻 Take care xx@janbaker97 @YorkFarmGirl @HannahD2009 I totally understand, but you need to start to try to make a change and give yourself a little break!!@janbaker97 @YorkFarmGirl @HannahD2009 Can you eat at school before start of day? Plenty of people seem to do it nowadays apparently!@janbaker97 @YorkFarmGirl @HannahD2009 What about porridge? I'm gluten intolerant but this works for me. Fruit tea is also lovely!@snappysara Oh dear, that's a bit dark!! I'm shocked, poor guy. Loved him on Supermarket Sweep!@janbaker97 Well I'm sure it can wait, healthy body healthy mind and all that!! Don't be afraid to bin things, or take them in to the staff room!!@janbaker97 Prob because it's oily? Do they have a support forum? You might find old hands are available to give advice on things to eat that fit your syns. I think unfortunately it doesn't necessarily follow a 'healthy' plan, although it works.@janbaker97 Did you try using the barcode scanner? SW must have their own version or something similar to help you. I don't really know the ins and outs, but there must be some fairly easy things to reach for?@janbaker97 I know you've joined slimming World, there seems to be a lot of random things about it, but have you tried using my fitness pal at all to help you log your meals?@JennyWrenKernow Happy Birthday Oskar! 🎂🎉☺️🎈@NatStatWeek @CrossPensUK Now that is a thing of beauty 💕 #stationeryaddict@flossy30 Yay!!! 🎉@flossy30 Fingers crossed for you him! I'm sure it'll all be fine 👍🏻@vickitoria35 Very annoying to start getting good weather when term starts though. Sod's law!! 🙄@vickitoria35 Sounds decent though! Hopefully it'll just be a shower overnight 👍🏻@vickitoria35 That's fair enough though. Supposed to get up to 23 degrees here this week, so must be similar (if not hotter) there surely?!@vickitoria35 Haha gets no better I'm afraid, L did that earlier when I nipped out 🙄😂@vickitoria35 Oh totally 😂😂😂 You'll be fine I'm sure, at least you don't need to pack loads of heavy winter gear - summer stuff is at least a bit lighter!@vickitoria35 Cute 😍@vickitoria35 Roll it!! Stuff things inside shoes!! You totally have my sympathies. Have you got the kitchen sink in there yet? 😉Thread 👇🏻 💕 https://t.co/9q1l4ygace@KathyKelliott Love this one 😍 https://t.co/238TNrB2x9@KathyKelliott  https://t.co/tqTSLrX6D7@KathyKelliott I've got too many!! https://t.co/uKlDN4DUDY@_FatGirlsCanRun Just in time for the warmer weather too!! 🌞@lakeslass Haha 😂😂 You'll do fab at GNR 👍🏻👍🏻 I do love a road half!@lakeslass Well done you!!

Where's the time gone?! It flies when you're having fun doesn't it ☺️ It all gets more interesting from now - chatting more, moving more, you see more of their little personality. So lovely 💕@vickitoria35 Ooh nasty!! Hope you're all feeling much better now!! Poorly with a poorly baby is no fun at all. Still, at least it's all out of the way in time for your hols. So exciting ☺️🎉@vickitoria35 Bit of a trek lol but then most places are from here! How's things with you?@vickitoria35 Have had a really lovely time thanks! Just back tonight, took 7hrs because of work on motorway 😣 but it has been a fab week. Longleat was so good! Got lots of cheese from Cheddar too 🧀👌🏻@vickitoria35 @runr_uk It is indeed. I definitely need something to focus on, races just tap in to every anxiety I've got at the moment 🙄 Thought 100 would be a nice round target!!@runr_uk @MindCharity Thanks, really glad to be supporting. It'll be a great boost to my own mental health if I've got something to make me get back out there again too xTaken the plunge...100 miles pledged 😲 All in aid of @runr_uk #MilesForMind an amazing cause!! Bring it on!! 💪🏻🏃🏻☺️@_FatGirlsCanRun 😂😂😂 Know this feeling well!!!@_FatGirlsCanRun Looking lovely!! Very brave move getting it chopped isn't it, but all ready for the summer now 👍🏻 I'm still growing mine, took ages to get past the awkward length phase!!@Tesco Apologies for the delay! I rang up this morning, think I'm sorted now as I've got the codes. Email still not working though 🤔 Thanks for your help!@Tesco having a problem with voucher codes! Ordered some day out vouchers via clubcard boost which were emailed, but clicking the voucher link it only shows a blank screen!! Can you help?@flossy30 Not sure where anything is in relation to each other lol 😂 but will see what's going on &amp; let you know. Not sure what we're doing, will be guided by the weather xx@nicky_doubleU That's just scary 😱@catherinerusse2 @mrjoemcfadden @NiamhAWalsh @RobOstlere @elliefanyinka @jemma_redgrave @BigRichFilms Love this 😍 Looks like a proper 'fantasy dinner party' thing!

I'm good thanks, plodding on 👍🏻 xHaha loving #PointlessCelebrities tonight, 1st round - German &amp; Spanish clothing.

Feel free to rant any time x@YorkFarmGirl Well over half way - you can do this!! 🚴💪🏻Pretty grim day out there 🌧️ Belle has the right idea💡 #Caturday #CatsOfTwitter https://t.co/zUr2i2fj2d@flossy30 Near Weston-super-Mare, only down Mon to Fri, hoping the weather will be nice!! Going to come over to Longleat one day though xx@nicky_doubleU Gorgeous 😍 Good morning to you both too xx@flossy30 Only to Somerset, at the stage now of getting everything ready and trying to teach the boys that they can't wear things they want to take 🙄@flossy30 Haha I know the feeling! All good here thanks, had a full day out just me yesterday which was lovely. Looking forward to hol next week 😊 xx@flossy30 Sounds busy, but glad you've had such a fun day. Hope you're enjoying the hols xx@snappysara I don't know about OF&amp;H but he was Mick on Brookie...@lakeslass @L17RGY Totally agree!! If I can be bothered, I'll wait til they're on sale 😉 otherwise I'll have to look for something else. The 19s are not good!@lakeslass @L17RGY interesting! Let me know how you get on with them. Apparently the nimbus 20 have reverted back to how they were before everything went wrong 🤔Morning run - done! Love the hols ☺️💕🏃🏻@marathon_sam Great news Sam! Can't believe you managed such an awesome run yesterday - wonder woman!! Hope this whole op ordeal is soon a distant memory xx@valleseco And why on earth should we have to change?! I have a strong accent too...the kids like the mystery!!@vickitoria35 I've got some others but the same style but same brand and they're lovely, lasted ages!!@vickitoria35 These are the ones I've seen today (cheaper than in shop grr!) https://t.co/KyawyFDE1d@vickitoria35 Oops!! Sorry!! 😬@vickitoria35 Hats. And suncream!! For you, swimming cossies and tshirts. Done! 👍🏻@vickitoria35 I've got sandal fever now, seen loads of lovely ones...even if it is too flipping cold to think about wearing them!! 😎 You've got lots to look forward to!! Hope you get lovely weather for some playtime on the beach with Jack 🏖️ x@runr_uk @MindCharity Fab, thank you! Will get myself sorted ASAP!!@runr_uk @MindCharity When does sign up close please?@lakeslass @L17RGY What have you gone for? A lady at club is usually an asics nimbus fan and has been recommended brooks ghost, they look lovely 😍@lakeslass Absolutely love it. So easy to get to and I know my way around. Logical choice, wish I'd stayed longer though lol 🤣@Jordon_Cox Good grief, 85 days!!! So glad to see you're out of hospital at long last. Take care x@lakeslass Decided randomly to go to Manchester so just got on the train and went! It was great! Amazing to just bod around and go where I wanted 👍🏻@vickitoria35 Bit annoyed though to find things cheaper on line than in shops, but that just means a big queue in my amazon basket now lol 😂 When are you away? Excited? It'll be so lovely for you all!!@vickitoria35 Went a bit over the top, could've been worse though 🤔 it was all too lovely in my defence!! https://t.co/x5CWkKtpzk@FromPaperchase went to Manchester today &amp; spent an hour in your store, love it in there!! Came away with plenty of lovely goodies, could easily have nabbed more. Thanks for taking in a lonely #stationeryaddict 💕 https://t.co/ePZdxT8Vsd@janbaker97 Nice work! I brought two sets home, marked them last weekend and took them back in yesterday 😂 fed up of tripping over them!!@L17RGY Pounds to shift? Don't be daft, you look great!! Nice trainers too 😍Lots of people watching today, very interesting what you notice when you actually look rather than rushing past #flyingsolo 🤔@Langwitch Saw that one the other day, hilarious!! 🤣@vickitoria35 It's been interesting! Had to really force myself to do it, but have enjoyed my day out. Maybe should've stayed out longer but I'd only spend more!! 😂 Train home now so home in a couple of hours. We'll have to meet up for a big day out!! xxOn a big day out today. Solo. There will be much people watching, stationery purchasing &amp; coffee ☺️ #abandoned #flyingsolo@nextofficial Love love love this colour 😍😍😍😍@chasingbadger All part of the plan 😉@teachergoals Not all pencils, just red pencils. Why only the red ones?! Argh!!@chasingbadger But you ran a half only 10 days ago!! You deserve a lunch out with your kids!! Sometimes you need to step back and rest a bit before you go back anyway, you don't want to run on empty. Maybe the running buddies being away is just a way of making you rest 😉 x@chasingbadger I feel your pain, I think it's really hard to get going again unless you have something forcing you out the door sometimes. Make a plan? Meet up with someone? Don't feel too bad about the cake though, it's the law at this time of year x@joanne_godding Aren't they brill! I have a consultant and specialist nurse for my Crohn's so I've got her mobile number in my phone when I need her. Invaluable!!@joanne_godding So sorry to hear this, but hope that everything is soon under control. Great that your consultant is so on the ball!! Take care x@L17RGY Haha, same!! Loving it!!@marathon_sam Oh wow I hate those 'x = 3 doughnuts' things 😣 Nicely said 👍🏻@L17RGY I know what you mean, exactly that!! I know it's about moving more and putting less in, but I'm struggling at the minute...maybe because I can't get off my backside though 😣 RH fitness is the group online@L17RGY I know, I think it's the being able to ask questions that I like the idea of. It's all about managing your macros but I'm feeling odd about eating more!!@L17RGY I got mine out yesterday for the first time in ages too. Could feel it!! Thinking of joining an online coaching group who get v good results...can't make myself click to pay though!! 🙄@jezza_9 Maybe start carrying the odd leaflet just to pop on the table as you leave 😂 Combination of ignorance &amp; nosiness. Folk are always funny about things they don't understand, it's just such a shame that they don't even try xx@jezza_9 Nicely said on both counts!!! There's nothing quite like feeling a bit embarrassed about doing something you need to do, is there?! Attitudes need to change. Don't like it? Don't look! Keep on keeping on Gerry xx@JennyWrenKernow Lucky lady!! I got absolutely nothing, just get to look at the heap of eggs in the kitchen 😣@Gazz_Long Weight stuff could be a good call, like you say, stepping out of your comfort zone could be a good thing to challenge you!! Good luck with it!!@Gazz_Long Oh that's not good, but totally understand why! I've got health issues that make it really difficult to get out. I know I can't go, it would be ridiculous, but doesn't stop you beating yourself up about it!! What kind of things are you trying? Swimming?@Gazz_Long So sorry to hear that, but definitely sensible!! How are you feeling about it all? Hard to do something then not be able to isn't it.@Gazz_Long Retirement? Hope all ok x@Amandahendrson @meamandamealing @OwainArthur So well played tonight, I have just about got over the heaving sobs!! 😢💔 Congrats to you all on a job very well done &amp; good luck with whatever's next! 🍀#Casualty Brokenhearted 😢 💔 So sad!!!@Jordon_Cox Signing up to mailing lists!! The offers are endless!! Hope you're doing well xHappy Hols to all! We made it!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Aaaaand breathe!!@flossy30 Sounds amazing! Hope you've had a lovely day x@flossy30 Yay!! Light at the end of the tunnel 🎉 Only one more day then a long weekend too.

Wishing you all the best for future projects, but keeping hope alive that Oliver will return to Holby one day 💕 #drvalentine@flossy30 Oh no, hope your day wasn't too bad in the end!! Hope are you getting on so far this week? xx@Roddeers84 Never!! Where does the time go?! Happy first birthday little lady xx@Jay84uk check this out, try this for a challenge in class 😂 https://t.co/fBho09P15TBig man back from camp. All is well with the world again 🙂@flossy30 I know what you mean. I sometimes find it hard to go to sleep on my own, so stay up a little later to feel more tired. Check out some box sets or a film you've not seen in ages, or even an early night the time soon flies xxx@flossy30 Don't worry hun, I'm sure everything will be fine!! J doesn't go away often, but I do find things run a bit more calmly in his absence 😂 Take it easy xxGorgeous gorgeous day ☀️😎 Great for a walk out with the little man 😍 https://t.co/8AZnNf8PTk@Jordon_Cox So glad you're feeling stronger!! Hope you get transferred soon. At least you're keeping yourself busy!! Nobody can accuse you of slacking 😉
I'm good thanks, ish. Having a rough week, feeling v dodgy. Trying to ride it out but we'll see... x@Jordon_Cox Congratulations 🎉 Great news! How are you keeping? Hope you're feeling better each day &amp; being well looked after. Any end in sight? Take care xBit late to the party today, but here's Belle on #Caturday #CatsOfTwitter #upcloseandpersonal 🐈💕 https://t.co/D49a0HA8eF@lakeslass Haha, I like this!! I like the smell of wet tarmac when it rains, freshly cut wood (love running past the wood yard!) and my weirdest one...i like the smell of the cat when she's been outside in the cold 😂🤨 I'm sure there's more strange ones lol x@niffler83 Totally know what you mean!@niffler83 I do this too! Frequently 😂@liammagee133 @lakeslass Isn't it just?!!!! 😂@lakeslass Haha love this!! My boys are March &amp; April and it is very true!!

How's the hair now? x@SenoraCT Oh wow, you've declared summer!! ☀️ Respect!! I'm not quite there yet...soon hopefully 👍🏻@lakeslass We went to Skye last year, stayed in a cottage just over the bridge at Kyleakin on Lochalsh - was beautiful! Going to Lewis in August 😍@ShellSimpsonxx I need to get back to this. Thinking about races is really making me anxious - killing my enthusiasm!!@vickitoria35 No, have made probably my first decent decision not to. Need to sort myself out, I don't think another will be on the cards for a while xx@lakeslass Thanks, it's not been my week I think! Will have to sort myself out for another time. Worse things happen at sea xx@KathyKelliott Thanks Kathy. Feel like a proper let down today!! xxPoll out of genuine interest! When you run, do you have a goal? How do you stay motivated to carry on? @UKRunChat #ukrunchat Interested in how/why you get out the door each time!!Feeling poorly 😣 not great on a supposed race day... 😞@marathon_sam Sending strength and gentle hugs 💕 Chin up, you're doing such a great job of fending this thing off - don't let it get you down now!! xx https://t.co/4HmDnN4CbE@janbaker97 Totally!! My kids love it (9 &amp; 4)@becciewatson Oh no, what's happened?! Hope your little lady is OK and hope it's being dealt with xI absolutely love Ollie &amp; Frieda 😍 Some great scenes lately for @jimeroo - I'm rooting for Ollie to prove everyone wrong!!  @BBCHolbyCity@snappysara Oh wow. And who's that benefiting again??@snappysara Sounds amazing! Glad she's putting things right 👍🏻@snappysara This could go on and on 😂 https://t.co/928fXmhmLj@snappysara Eek!! That sounds a bit scary, was it painful?? Hope you're feeling a bit better x@vickitoria35 Aww love this!! 😍@snappysara Loving this. Don't think I've ever replied with a gif! Might be my new thing 😎 https://t.co/v9vjJYT1JZ@snappysara  https://t.co/CkpF0C24Nj@L17RGY Awful isn't it 😞😡 😢@marathon_sam Took stealth to get that pic without disturbing her!! 😂😂
