As a female assistant I already refuse to do anything but help at meetings with the male leader. No trips, nothing. Pandora’s box that doesn’t need to be opened.@anghunt26 @RealBlakeKasper @trumpicon @CamdenArlauckas @JordanHB77 @RevK78 @jdennis115 @chandler_lassen @boyscouts As a female and an assistant den leader I am very disappointed in this decision. If girls want to do these things so much then the GS needs to step up and offer what girls want.@sonicdrivein It was the Loganville GA location, around 8:30 pm 5/1/2018.@boyscouts Probably have to pull my boys now which is sad. Oldest was to cross over to BSA in Feb 2019. As an assistant leader I had already said I wouldn’t go on the camping trips b/c I’m female. If GS is so bad FIX IT. Pandora’s box being opened.  #disappointed #BOYscoutsThat is supposed to be a BLT. Worst sandwich I’ve ever gotten anywhere. Thanks a lot @sonicdrivein. 😡 #burnedbacon #whatbacon https://t.co/dE2Zca1SNl@DeadliestCatch Too bad we can’t watch the @FVTimeBandit this year. 😡Hey @Discovery. Wrong choice not having #TimeBandit on @DeadliestCatch.When you ask for no fried onions on your Zalad &amp; hubby goes in to order to make sure they hear him. So tired of this. 😡 @Zaxbys https://t.co/GreIq4agaNYay! #AhsokaLives! Now can we have Ashley in a live action Obi-Wan movie w/ Ewan M?? Like yesterday?! I need that in my life. @HerUniverse @starwars #please #PrettyPlease #withacherryontop #takemymoneynowOk. Really. Go back to vocal free music in routines. Seems juvenile and is distracting. @ISU_Figure #figureskating@starwars No quiz needed. Just gimme Obi-Wan. https://t.co/hnToGN1GwoReally. Can we go back to no vocals in figure skating music? It’s so distracting. @USFigureSkating #whoelsecanItagCan we go back to no music with vocals in #Olympic #figureskating?

Nvm. #NatsNoRainDelayThat wet grass clearly played a part in how that ball rolled. @kapaya1234@JebBurtonRacing That's how I felt during the Braves/Nats delay ... #NatsNoRainDelayI found the rain that caused the delay. In Kentucky. @kapaya1234 #NatsNoRainDelay https://t.co/SpkuT7U5eI@TrackSweeper @TheOrangeCone @elginsweeper @KySpeedway @NASCAR_Trucks @NASCARONFOX Guess that's the rain they were delaying the Braves/Nats game for. 😡 #NatsNoRainDelay@FOXSportsBraves @Bravesmeme This wins. #NatsNoRainDelay#NatsNoRainDelay https://t.co/bDIMSJT4TD@Jim_Powell How can they get away with this?@Braves They shouldn't be allowed to get away with this. #NatsNoRainDelay@DChandleyFOX5 They did it in May against another team. Haven't heard of any repercussions. It's ridiculous they get away with it.@kapaya1234 Was anything said by MLB after that?@Mr_Paul_M_Smith @Braves Except it wasn't raining in DC ...@kapaya1234 How can they even be able to get away with this?@Nationals Soooo....when is it going to rain?Why am I not surprised the @Nationals are embarrassing themselves? They're scared.@masterpiecepbs That scene was fantastic. #GrantchesterPBSI am sooooo glad #GrantchesterPBS is back on! I've missed having a good show to watch. @GrantchesterUKSidney holding that baby and crying. Yeah ... that melted my heart. #GrantchesterPBS @GrantchesterUKSo dude with the face tats looks like he fell asleep in a room of preschoolers armed w/ Sharpies. #georgiafugitives @wsbtv @FOX5AtlantaWatching reruns of @DuckDynastyAE makes me happy. Miss seeing @bosshogswife @JessicaDuckWife and all the rest each week.So when does the adding of butt/fart/poop to every sentence stage end? #boymom #parenting@LoganMBooker Omg yes!!! Thank you for this wonderful information!!Best subscription box around! :) https://t.co/wHdE2FgHx7Tried to watch a bit of that #KingCharlesIII. What a load of complete and utter rubbish. @masterpiecepbs@Bravesmeme Let's not talk about that...@Bravesmeme I'm waiting. Got the popcorn ready.Do not use your churros as lightsabers. #boymom #parenting #starwars@AtlantaBread Why why did you close Snellville &amp;a Mall of GA?? Now there's no location near me! 😩 #sosad #wantchickensaladOmg. Why @SUBWAY why??? Why did you take away the carved turkey??? #bestsub #disappointed #letdown #bringitbackOmg this is too cute! https://t.co/qQrsBi6XVz@GwinnettBraves Can we bring lightsabers into the stadium? Plastic and metal ones? :)First impression of #SunTrustPark : meh. Expensive, narrow &amp; confining concourses, hard to get around. @Braves@Bravesmeme We sat in the crappy traffic for this ... and cold rain.@mp_willow @Braves The traffic? Heck no. This is way worse than our easy drive to Turner Field on I-20.Getting to this @Braves game sucks. Worst traffic around and they plop a stadium in the middle of it.Can we take lightsabers into the game tomorrow night? Plastic and/or metal? @Braves #starwarsnight #braves #imajedi@LoganMBooker https://t.co/F65j2PDtom@SharylAttkisson Star WarsStay up for any news from #BuckinghamPalace or go to bed b/c I have to work tomorrow? #QueenElizabeth #GodSavetheQueen 🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧Prayers for #QueenElizabeth and family as we wait for news about this 3am meeting.  4 hours to wait. #BuckinghamPalace@marthamaccallum Any word on if family has been called as well?@marthamaccallum Wouldn't we hear that the family has been called too if it was what we're hoping it's not?@Rompess I love this gif!!!@KensingtonRoyal So cute!

Not an anime fan but looking forward to seeing what is created this week. :) #CosplayMelee@Braves Well makes zero sense. Smh.@okmesonet I'll keep fingers crossed then. He's still a couple years from being old enough. :)@okmesonet Do you think you'll be offering summer weather camp again? My son met y'all in Atlanta a few years ago but wasn't old enough.@Quaintlyuk Is it more Downton or Highclere themed?After watching @CosplayMelee I want to get up and work on my Jedi ... but it's almost midnight lol! #CosplayMelee #bewhatyouwantI'm giggling every time I hear their reaction to the cape. :) #CosplayMelee @CosplayMeleeThe full costume plans for all 3 contestants look awesome! #cosplay #CosplayMelee @CosplayMeleeThat would be my generation probably. https://t.co/dGKTnderPuHahaha!! https://t.co/C7LdVsIKIVThis. https://t.co/FIT0qk4KHUThought #IronChefGauntlet would be more Iron Chef America but it seems like rebranded Next Iron Chef. #disappointing #wannaseebobbycook@Bravesmeme I always mute the national tv guys.@FOXSportsBraves @FOXSportsSouth @Braves @FS1 Yeah, can't even find SS. Despise national tv coverage b/c we always get screwed.@Braves Except the national channel isn't showing it yet and don't have any of the others. HATE national tv coverage of the Braves.#SWCO live stream is great except when they're watching something on screen but the stream isn't showing it ...Oh heck yeah! @CosplayMelee on demand! Catching up on a couple episodes I've missed since I'm laid up with a messed up foot. #CosplayMeleeNot all those who wander are lost. #Tolkien #MiddleEarth #RangeroftheNorth #photoshoot @WeGeekGirls @theoneringnet https://t.co/7rcnGCQSzQYup. I cried. Our family has loved watching yours for 5 years. Y'all will be greatly missed. @DuckDynastyAE @bosshogswife @JessicaDuckWifeI don't like to contemplate what Wednesdays will be like without @DuckDynastyAE. #DuckDynastyOkay. The black, purple, and green one is pretty creepy ... but pretty amazing! @CosplayMelee #cosplay #CosplayMeleeWow. 9 foot wing span and great detail on the chest plate. Very cool. @CosplayMelee #cosplay #CosplayMeleeIt's time for @CosplayMelee. Love the creativity these folks show. #cosplay #CosplayMeleeOmg he is too adorable! https://t.co/m5FSnWBCuSWhy is #DarthVader in my refrigerator?
