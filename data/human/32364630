#Wokingham MP John Redwood's office in Wokingham now has a Labour councillor - @RachelBurgessLP . That is a break though.  He lost the Chair of his Conservative Association and Deputy Leader of the Borough council on 16% swing.
Amazing. https://t.co/q6WzuUmnkb@PrueBray Nothing is working. Everything hurts. My head is exploded.It is absolutely  stunning. Still can't believe it. https://t.co/wbgeqU7nrB@DavidPrescott @HackneyAbbott 1% left on the phone...if Rudd had tweeted at 11 she would have escaped!Seems people are taking #Wokingham MP John Redwood's advice. https://t.co/NIaaYrgVRK@WillRic65692146 @WoodleyLabour What time is it there?How are things in Moscow WillRic65692146 ? https://t.co/s7Ox9QE7B2John Redwood not really banging the drum for #Wokingham schools here. Asking for a 'little bit more' is simply not good enough. Barely noticed and brushed off. https://t.co/0B4UuRSXpnTwitter, what on earth is a 'White people Facebook check-in' and why does the #Wokingham Tory candidate for #Winnersh need to do one? https://t.co/L4VZvLjN6j@McFarlandFraser @henrydarby How did no one in #Wokingham Tories know of the Islamophobia?@BracknellLabour Ahh still terrible for those involved.@BracknellLabour That is huge! 908  people or nights?@BracknellLabour Borough with the biggest decline in bus usage in the country@Shelter @AG_RAG Thank you! Looks like the lookup is returning the 2015 numbers which explains it.@AG_RAG @Shelter I assume  the post code returns a Borough result.@AG_RAG @Shelter Cllrs receive a quarterly briefing pack. Cllr P Jorgemsen was quoting over 2k but I have not seen that number, just high 1900s@AG_RAG Not sure what data they are using but for Wokingham Borough the number of household is about 2000 not the 1600 this reports.#Wokingham and #Woodley have fewer police due to Tory austerity.  #CutsHaveConsequences https://t.co/njkHk6pgyT@nikimcglynn It's her party's dogma which is the problem.Gobsmacked #Wokingham Tory councillor considers difference between social and affordable housing as 'dogma'. £200 a month might be dogma to her but back in the real world it is a lot of money.Hard working people in #Wokingham and #Woodley deserve a bank holiday today. https://t.co/b6rpMQgSu7@PrueBray @BracknellLabour Aha! The austerity party are here! 
Good morning Prue!Shame of #Wokingham Tories as they sit on 4th largest pile of cash in the country for social housing. Their local policy is to sell the few remaining council houses asap.  

Revealed: Councils have failed to spend £375m earmarked to ease the housing crisis https://t.co/DR6rXojini@EL4JC @AnnabelWoky This is almost exactly what an affluent  life long Tory  voter stopped me in the street in #Wokingham and told me on Friday. Incandescent about #WindrushScandal . Won't be be voting Tory again.Good news for thousands of people in #Wokingham and #Woodley . Tories have nothing, nothing, to offer. 

Britain’s housing market is broken. Here’s how Labour will fix it

https://t.co/cwjucokBAzDouble standards of one of #Wokingham Borough MPs. https://t.co/jqtlugbDa6Theresa May promoted a policy which some ministers thought was 'reminiscent of the Nazis'.  If only there had been some sort of moderating force in cabinet. https://t.co/CkfSidSYicGood news for thousands of people in #Wokingham Borough. https://t.co/cf04zvtOpU7 years of pay cuts. Thousands of personnel short. Tories are selling services short and  leave us more vulnerable.  https://t.co/Sh2a0w3pszEvil, evil, just evil. https://t.co/OzRyIJl6P9Theresa May is saying it is a mistake??  Unbelievable.  There's only person who needs to go home and that's her. Unfit for office.#Wokingham #Shinfield residents need councillors who will work for residents all through the year, not just a elections. Speeding in Shinfield is one issue we have been tackling. https://t.co/TiGh7pyWIzCorrection to last tweet.
"First they destroyed the proofs of arrivals. Then the sent round vans saying 'Go home'. Then they came for the #WindrushGeneration ...'First, they came for the #WindrushGeneration ...

The shameful Windrush saga has struck fear into EU nationals’ hearts

https://t.co/9hTXBaKtZNLet's be clear. The #Windrush outrage is #TheresaMaysWindrush outrage.@ImogenSD @WokinghamTories @markashwelluk Reminds me of the 80s Daily Mail advert ...'wokingham not snoozingham'@ImogenSD @WokinghamTories @markashwelluk Less congested perhaps as one of your Finch candidates seems to be building railway stations...@WokinghamLabour  manifesto for #Wokingham Borough #TimeForChange

Warden also here.@JonnyR_Labour  good luck!15% cut in teachers' pay. What a mess.

On Wednesday, the commons debated local government funding. 
Here is John Redwood's contribution, "_________".
Nothing. Nada. Zilch.@SoggyFox Ughh don't. Brave new global Britain shipping jobs abroad.May promising to keep the UK united is pretty much the death knell for the union.
