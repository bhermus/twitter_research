Or his third shutout of the playoffs. #PickTheMoment@SinBinVegas Was gonna watch and ask questions but I fell asleep last night üòÇ it seemed like there was a TON of waived icing calls for San Jose last night. Did I just have a bad angle to see it properly?Sidenote. Both games I had a glitter beard for went to double ot.Oh and they've only been able to beat us in OT.@AndrewWilsonDPT @SinBinVegas Is his weight on the stick instead of his feet? Shouldn't he be on his skates ready to react?@AndrewWilsonDPT @SinBinVegas Not saying he dove. But if this is the rule what I posted can happen. Also trying figure out why his right leg randomly shoots out@SinBinVegas can we get some breakdown gifs on the non interference on Fleury?@JRPothier I'm excited to when someone gives me a surprise present.@AndrewWilsonDPT @SinBinVegas So he can hold out his stick, a player hits it, take a dive, and get interference?@SinBinVegas Like calling traveling on a game winning shot in an OT NBA playoff gameLet's recap:

All goals scored with VGK in penalty box
No goalie interference when Fleury knocked over
Goalie interference disallows game winning goal
Yep, officials decided that one. #VegasBorn #GoKnightsGoJust walked by @hannibalburess leaving the Knights game so at least that was cool.@Cduffy922 @SinBinVegas Jones left it@MarcoAyala92 @GoldenKnights Me too? https://t.co/VoH1TUVBRk@GoldenKnights Foot outside the crease. Stick and arm way outside. No interference.@SinBinVegas And he's not in the creasePretty sure he was outside the crease when contact occured too. Such a joke call."A memo was circulated around the league saying officials should watch the play at normal speed and, unless an obvious foul pops up, the original call on the ice should stand."Amazing how the San Jose goal wasn't interference but somehow that was. NHL wants more games in the series?@SinBinVegas I didn't think that mattered.Glittered up again for game 2. #GoKnightsGo #VegasBorn #vgk https://t.co/QzYh8gnmCB@Shocked87 @loops73 @ShadowKin_ @CaraAleatorio @Xmoda The other guy said "Exactly my point.
