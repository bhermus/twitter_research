He is up there on his own, and I expect all five biggest clay titles in 2018, two out of five already wrapped up@bgtennisnation Yeah, four straight defeats@bgtennisnation He is ready for that challenge Brad, and I'm not sure there's a player who could stop him at the moment. The only problem I see is winning Madrid and Rome in back-to-back weeks, as he could be tired.
