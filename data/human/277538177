#firematheny this is 2 games in 1 week that he has made terrible decisions.@JoeTrezz He needs to be fired.  Terrible@JoeTrezz Why does Bowman still have a roster spot?Matt Bowman is terrible@MJyouthPastor It’s because of Mabry.  He needs to be fired.@realnathanjohn Yeah man all is well.  I am actually serving now in Palatine, IL.  Pretty close to your dads church I think.  How are things with you?@dgoold Great article.  So even though Brebbia is up now he doesn’t make the league minimum because he started in Memphis?@realnathanjohn Is that really Ben?  Haha thats awesome!@KirkW97 By the definition of logical, yes.  Because it is who you know in this world.“But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life.”
1 Timothy 1:16 NLT@MJyouthPastor Doing well.  Enjoying living in the suburbs again.  How are things for you?@MJyouthPastor It’s ridiculous.  Social media is a terrible tool for elections.@Dave_Matter Considering Mizzou is on the 8/9 potential, or possibly 7/10.  How much do you think the NCAA Committee would love to see Mizzou vs. Kansas potentially in the 2nd round?  It is just great for college basketball.@Dave_Matter @stltoday Dave how is the APR looking for Mizzou this offseason?  Will they have to forfeit any scholarships, or be under probation again?@Dave_Matter They have Phillips off of the roster on mutigers.  Is he off the team?@Dave_Matter Any news on the visit?@dgoold Is Wainwright in that top 5?  He should be at 12 or 13.@Dave_Matter @stltoday How could MIzzou have 7 scholarships available if MPJ and Phillips leave?  When I am counting 7 scholarships... Smith, Jontay, Nicko, Geist, Tilmon, Puryear, Van Leer. That is 7.  So they would only be able to add 6 correct?"For the Lord gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding."  Proverbs 2:6@hochman @alec_lewis Why isn’t Suggs playing this year?  He is a walk on.@RandyKarraker @101ESPNFastLane Will there be an excerpt from this interview?@RamsNFL need to run the ball.  You have a top 5 back and you don’t run the ball one time on that drive.  At least they scored.@ryansteigerwald Great to meet you on Sunday!  I would love to connect with you sometime in the near the future outside of the church.  God bless man!@lavamoose72 WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!!!!!!!!@Dave_Matter Basketball@Dave_Matter Which of the juniors could potentially graduate early and be graduate transfers?@Frank_Cusumano Good article Frank@Dave_Matter How does Roberts feel about this?  I am sure there is some dislike.@Dave_Matter Where is some updated live stats?@_ChrisStanley Maddon over thinking if he needs to bring him in for a save later in the game@Dave_Matter Why not live stream then?@TheRichSalgado Thanks for the curly!  Forgot what it was.  I want then or the Astros to win.  Be awesome to see both teams in the series.@TheRichSalgado Got my cardinals shirt on for you guys!  #flythecrookedW@AG_Youth @TheRichSalgado you’re famous?@dgoold Is their still a chance for Mabry to get the ax?@TMobile 2011 Game 6 Cardinals vs. Rangers. Best baseball game ever. 11 innings walk off HR by Freese. Comeback Cardinals! #TmobileTuesdays #Contest@JakeTalbert That’s terrible.  That is like saying I would rather not plant any seeds in peoples lives than trying to plant seeds.  Yes I christianized.@JakeTalbert There is still hope we could clinch the wild card.@JakeTalbert Track record Molina is a clutch player.  Give the dude some praise.  He will win another gold glove this year.@Dave_Matter do you feel Odom is on the hot seat?  If he is canned, would Les Miles be interested at all in the job?@lavamoose72 Dude I wanted this Tuesday night.  That's my love language@miklasz why didn't he keep in Lyons.  #firematheny@CBSBigBrother Jason gets my vote for favorite houseguest now.  I have been waiting all season for someone to do something different.@CBSBigBrother Best big brother episode this season.  Finally something didn't go Paul's way.@dgoold It would just be Lynn, but guys aren't proven yet.  Our starters have been good, but the bullpen and hitting needs help.  Use money for that@JakeTalbert @miklasz Forget Waino.  Love the guy, but he stinks.@dgoold Why do they need to add a starter?  Martinez, Wacha, Reyes, Weaver, Flahtery.  Not to mention Waino.  Thats 6 Lynn would be 7.@miklasz I think Lynn is good, but what about Reyes, Weaver, and Flahtery?  Do you do something to get rid of Waino?  Thats 6 starters plus Wacha.@miklasz Where was Lyons last night????@CBSBigBrother how do you get tickets to the show?  My wife's 30th bday is 9/23.  We will be in LA that week.  Would love to take her.@LangoschMLB Bowman looked sharp.  Why wouldn't he keep him in another inning?  The ball was jumping out of his hand.
