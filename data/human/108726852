The CWs?@ehjovan @JediFett I tryout for Big Brother and stop Paul from going far on BB18@TrinaDeLaSuerte Now you'll understand the memes.

A Trip to Chicago,KC, or Minneapolis wouldn't hurtI remember this so much and loved the Nat'l attention. It's sounds like a movie https://t.co/hmTvq06oYtI can't take or give oral.

Although I'm admittedly a virgin@FoldableHuman @ActionZacku Everything nice they do is basically negated if they kill anyone they disagree with#Dead https://t.co/66a4Hqp2Z1And more references to the 02 epilogue. (The 02 guys are hospitalized)Wait, Dark Gennai/Emperor Ken has a small little cube for some reason, says something about Daemon and etc.And now Meicomon is gone (at least for now). The Good Guys win

(And where in the fuck is the 02 guys, we know they're there)Oh okay, so Gatomon's Mega is Megadramon again like in Digimon The Movie.Trust in the Process they said, drop the confetti they said #NBAPlayoffs #NBATai is here finally and they're fucking padding with evolutions AGAINOnto the last ep of Tri. Still no sign of TaiWhat is that song from Robot Chicken End Credits? Boston needs that right nowFuck it, let's make a non indoor FB Barnstormers a reality.Alliance of American Football looks way more organized than the XFL TBH. 

Would pop if they chose Des Moines or central Iowa (Drake Stadium or Jack Trice probably)@ThatGuyB_ri @JediFett @eplandnfl Why is Pizza 7/1?My cousin's dog died yesterday while my aunt was with him. Turns out he had cancer in every organ but showed no real symptoms. We were a wreck because he died suddenly in the backyard.@hamsterwatch CBB might have something to do with it? That's the only plausible thing, I'm thinking they might go for a live launch too. Who knows.@hamsterwatch Hopefully we get news on the BB Launch date. Really odd that we don't have it yetI want to watch the Sounders on my TV with ESPN+ but I need my dad's cable log in info....

ESPN+ is pretty snazzy tho.Wish that I wasn't working tomorrow so I could go to Revolver tonight@itstherapcritic @FearlessRiOT Missy Elliott and Left Eye say hello@yugiohtas @DigiRanger1994 I like the Suicide Squad/Injustice 2 design.Oh wow..... https://t.co/x7PGkWelJrLol.

NevermindSome Hillary supports are blind and some Bernie supporters are too.

Both should get over it but they won't.@TrinaDeLaSuerte Lost it at the Hart comparison cause it's trueBloody hell.....pull through Alex https://t.co/xgosG0ZFjuI honestly can't figure out a solution that wouldn't turn leftists into the very monsters they despise without the obvious solutions like reinstating the fairness doc and heavy campaign regulation.They've selectively stood up to Trump for the clicks.

This won't change until you regulate what can be advertised on the internet and regulate (as in ban) obvious clickbait. https://t.co/NJuyRwkXwjPrivilege https://t.co/sG76arQAZyAnd before any of you motherfuckers laugh.

This affects you. https://t.co/DUJhoSM2zt@KoushiroIzumi Part 6 ain't that bad tho.

Danny revealed everything to his parents.Avengers 4: Starlord really fucked up so why are we trying to fix this shit? https://t.co/8t6inuZqDjKaty and Lionel have been great.......Luke not so much https://t.co/CxcVVb8oIy@Bury_Windham He actually looks worse than "Paige here" Paige.Not that it really mattered since Clubs could deny because it's not CONCACAF so more than likely a NA squad would go https://t.co/CRHeXEOqpu@y2stump Don't do that plsGod I wish Darrell would say this for real and never appear on TV ever again https://t.co/2TngIGQSCE@FearlessRiOT Yeah.
