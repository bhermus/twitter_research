Started strong with a loss after loss and I couldn't even get back into the 1800 range. Goal is the same as last season beating my all time high of 2089. Expanded my roster a wee bit too last season.@laneyybugz Had a buff chick cheese steak and it was trash the sauce was not even on the chicken@laneyybugz No that's a fact"That's right. George Washington took office as the first president of the United States of America 200 years ago today. And it happened right here. We were going to declare  another independence -- the dawn of a new nation -- here. The end of the Patriots' secret rule." -Solidus https://t.co/TT0qmZmv4L@songsinthekeyof WATER FLOWING UNDERGROUND!One of the best posters Marvel has ever put out https://t.co/mhhJYcCZ8kI need a Infinity Gauntlet https://t.co/rJScN2VFqw"Movie of the generation" -@alexbarbs https://t.co/DRq3NGgU7kApril 30th....? #MetalGearSolid https://t.co/Lmw9i8eUeU@ResistanceFox  https://t.co/yZOxlWfvHl@JebDan  https://t.co/gAkuL36502@MMOINKS @JebDan @MarvelStudios Inks..... ascend@JebDan @MarvelStudios Jebro see infinity so you can become a better you@edenoth Time to retire hahaHey @GameOverGreggy happy birthday brother, hope you have a great weekend with your friends and family.
