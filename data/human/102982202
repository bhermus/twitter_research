Hopefully someone at Stack Overflow will read this and realize they're mainstream now. They no longer need to tailor their service for the alpha-geek niche and they shouldn't. https://t.co/fUaiasehbY@JeremyLaine Marketing is hard :pThanks everyone who provided feedback on the draft, that post would be very much worse without your help — and may never have been published without your support ;-)My first blog post ever!

Follow @FractalIdeas if you'd like to hear about future posts :-) https://t.co/jKSXkmdm7BThanks to everyone who offered to help, I sent a DM (hopefully - @Twitter's web UI said there was an error but apparently it went through?)Actually I'd be willing to pay for professional copy-editing (just need a reasonable price &amp; formal invoice) - aymeric.augustin@fractalideas.comIf you can help, let me know and I'll send a link.I'm working my first blog post ever — about React and Django — and I'd love if someone could tell me how bad it is^W^W^W^W^W^W provide feedback before I hit "publish". #ImpostorSyndrome#previoustweet brought to you by the quarterly keyboard failure on my MacBook Pro.Apple TouchBar team: "We're going to ship the most useless MacBook Pro component ever."

This will be fun. https://t.co/qSxgSAmTbqHomemade goban is looking pretty good. It should outlast me. (Kids wanted to learn, so I needed a 9x9 board.) https://t.co/BNZ05tXjMxHalf of the reasons why I started this projects were "friends don't let friends run NodeJS in production", after you told me about what you did for @spacivox :-) https://t.co/7CqPmzOPS1@GrahamDumpleton Great work! Thanks!Today I realized I can’t explain the slides of my own keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2014 anymore. Ha ha. Well. Good thing it was recorded. I sure hope that app-loading code works.The value / cost ratio of Let's Encrypt is just one of their many amazing achievements. https://t.co/SPxXa6EHrS@das_kube @Xof TTGSD (time to getting shit done) — by a solo dev in that case, which is part of the problem@SamuelMichaud Yes it's a real issue when you only have asynchronous communications and each step towards consensus takes a day."minimize delays caused by distributed consensus across timezones" #OpenSourceProblems

(especially noticeable when making hiring decisions)@fapolloner @limedaring It's really good. Clear, concise and encouraging."the entire Visa credit network uses about a three-thousandth the total energy of Bitcoin" https://t.co/XSBSqSBHnP@freakboy3742 @andrewgodwin I didn't look at it too deeply but that conclusion is consistent with my understanding of  asyncio.PS - if you're using open-source libraries of mine, they're ready for Django 2.0.Django 2.0 is there! https://t.co/2YMwtUGfWf

Simpler URLconfs, responsive admin and many internal cleanups.

Leaves Python 2 behind :-)@freakboy3742 Most expect LOGGING_CONFIG = { my config } to be the Django way to configure logging, not LOGGING_CONFIG = None; logging.config.dictConfig({ manual merge of Django’s and my config }).@freakboy3742 “I'll start by bypassing Django's default logging as described in my previous post.” / LOGGING_CONFIG = None@ericholscher I'm also doing this in all my projects because it's more predictable. You can really configure Python logging only once.I wish "work around Django's logging system" won't remain the best practice forever :-| https://t.co/vHbnwqALWD@patrys @Xof To be clear : my point here is about exception silencing, a behavior which is rarely documented but essential for data integrity.@patrys @Xof « may be executed inline » — depending on whether the sender uses send or send_robust. Who needs integrity?@Xof @patrys Usually Django signals aren't the best solution when you control the whole codebase or when you have an alternative.

Thanks, whoever did it!@_tomchristie @sjoerdjob @EmilStenstrom @timograham Yes, none of us cared enough to do it all alone, but together we did it!@sjoerdjob @EmilStenstrom @_tomchristie @timograham Context: writing regexes (in URLconfs) isn't a prerequisite for using Django anymore. That's much more convenient and beginner-friendly.DEP201 merged! https://t.co/TosFqh8WR6 Thanks @sjoerdjob, @EmilStenstrom, @_tomchristie, @timograham, and everyone else!@voidspace I don't hate my coworkers enough to return something other than a subclass.I put than in production more than once. https://t.co/TjkPfBxWEU@ipmb Simple things are complicated.
