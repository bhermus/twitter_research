In that case, I'll just open this link to something he's calling his "tiny hairless rat-mole"Guy says thanks and he’s just gonna go get his friends. 25 more people in black suits and mink coats proceed to come into restaurant to get lit with to-go cups. They’re literally dancing as they get served double fists. Chicago is a special place.At a Chicago restaurant, a guy in a black suit asks bartender if he and a few of his friends can get a cocktail to go. Bartender says that’s illegal, sorry. Guy responds with “I’m on my way to a funeral, think you can look the other way?” Bartender reluctantly agrees.https://t.co/3gjNbgye0T#CrazyExGirlfriend season 4 pickup!!!!!!!
