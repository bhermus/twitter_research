That‚Äôs just bad service.@Ask_Spectrum Are you following me? Because now my cable is completely out.   WTF.@Ask_Spectrum No. Your service failed in the bottom of the 9th &amp; the top of the 10th after watching all night.  Sort of like missing the third act of a play...and the encore!@Ask_Spectrum Hey Charter...why is the Brewers game down....again?  Seriously...@Haudricourt The attendance percentage is nearly the same, with the jerk-percentage down.@chefsymon As a Packers fan i strongly urge y‚Äôall to pick the best QB #1.  Having a QB makes all the difference.  BTW - Loved Mabel‚Äôs!@rossacrosswi You can pay for a lot of denim with that kind of money.  üëñüí∞@jessieopie Fake news.@jessieopie @RepDoyle Works for me.@Chippewaffles @analieseeicher I brought the dog to the couch.

It‚Äôs like Xmas without the snow!@rossacrosswi If this holds in PA18, do we have to use the ‚Äúword‚Äù yinz to celebrate?@davidfrum Disgusting, historically inaccurate and delusional.@BenningtonShow Night Train - James Brown@analieseeicher I mean I‚Äôm totally right.Let‚Äôs hope Bob Costas can avoid pink eye during this edition of the Winter Olympics.Jimmy the Groundhog has seen his shadow.  Unfortunately this means six more weeks of winter.  #GroundhogDay #SunPrairie@EdmarkDarren @nameredacted5 @OutskirtWrigley @Brewers @Cubs I‚Äôve been a ticket holder since 2006.   How long have you been a ticket holder at Wrigley least that long?  Cool.@saynerken @nameredacted5 @OutskirtWrigley @Brewers @Cubs 10 of the last 11 seasons the Brewers have drawn more than 2.5 million in attendance.  Please re-Work your failed talking points.@nameredacted5 @OutskirtWrigley @Brewers @Cubs Be proud.  You only had a $100MM payroll advantage over us in 2017 &amp; had to empty out your minors to pass us.  All while we were in Year 2 of a rebuild.  Good stuff.@OutskirtWrigley @Brewers Yes the 2002-2003 Ulice Payne era. Seems like quite the dated reference.@SamWallaceTel he forgot his own history:  https://t.co/sfY18DQ4OT@ChelsTransfer https://t.co/sfY18DQ4OT@Malachians This is part of the Jose cycle.  Season 3 has started early...@danlevene @pitchowners Heck I live across the pond and have a share!@abeeson20 This is difficult.  I want the Big 10 to win, but don‚Äôt want to cheer for Harbaugh.@TheOtherMandela I thought the Right Said Fred cameo was awkward.Did Waukesha County report yet? #ElectionNight@dzander7 Eddie Lacy.  Book it.Watching Iron Chef.   Why would someone purposefully challenge Michael Symon?  @chefsymonCongrats to the Houston Astros.  What an amazing World Series!As part of #Halloween, a kid from the neighborhood took my candy then talked trash about @ChelseaFC.   Game on kid, game on.@MenInBlazers Wenger tried to sign him as a 16-year old but thought he wanted too much money.@JacsonBevens except Rodgers... https://t.co/YifMXcAz8K@onlxn y‚Äôall are brutalizing me.Can baseball managers please stop throwing their closers for multiple innings in the playoffs? Thanks.@WellDBell As constructed, yes.   But I wanted young Frank v old Frank.@analieseeicher They are emboldened by the walnut tree.@RickeyH35 @Brewers So.  Damn.  Close.@SiriusXMFC @PLinUSA @RodneyMarsh10 @TommySmythESPN N'golo Kante.  Chelsea would fall apart without him!@TommySmythESPN After watching Chelsea v Madrid today, I'm wondering why so many only seem to talk about 2 Manchester clubs for EPL title!@analieseeicher Don McLean, NOT John Denver.   https://t.co/hIcdL2CHDU@gbrilo @Haudricourt @lanegrindle this explains my confusion!  Thanks Gary!@Haudricourt The PA announcer at Miller Park sounds different than usual.  Is he new?
