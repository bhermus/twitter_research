Well deserved 👏🏽🙏🏽Why do I keep doing this to myself? Shantéh, just stick to the callaloo, fritters and punch.@TINYMANMUSIC I wanted saltfish, dem nah ave none. So I got a chicken one. Worst mistake I’ve ever made.@problematic_tee 😂 but when I’m hungry and I’m a rush, they’re so close to my bus stop! Healthy Eater patties are decent, but no patties touch Atlantic Bakery’s 🙌🏽@TINYMANMUSIC Bro... It really is. I can’t back them in the pattie department anymore 😔@problematic_tee Refilllllllll 😩😭 The patties at Delly’s may just be better nephew 🤦🏽‍♀️@MissJBKA They never have salt fish ones either! So I try to substitute it but they just suck.I need to stop going to this place and buying their dead patties. They always disappoint me 😔We had the amazing @whoislongy as our featured act at the last #SE12LIVE open mic!
