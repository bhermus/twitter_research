Jones SodasThe Weeknd does two EP’s instead of a full record 🤔So prepared for the next Avengers FilmI have to relearn a bunch of Rise Against songs so I don’t feel out of place at their showMultiple Sources of Income is the goal 🤙🏻People are chirping Gambino so hard for his dancing...that’s literally the purpose of the video. He’s distracting you with stupid shit from the violence and injustice occurring behind him. Super huge political statement by him and people can’t see past his dancing 😅I’m seeing AFI and Rise Against in July, I feel like I’m in Highschool again@Kevin_L_Johnson Congrats my man, such a great show!“I thought love was in the drugs. The more I took, the more i took away”The new Gambino Song is meh, but the message and meaning behind the piece is amazing. Don’t get distracted by all the good, be the one to acknowledge and change the bad.Summer = Tim McGraw being in my playlists@_emilysnowden If this is about Riverdale I agree. Shite ass musical episodesI’ve wanted to have an actual party for my birthday for years but I haven’t had the chance@RonDonRon https://t.co/dztd83VEJgPost Malone’s Record is actually really good. Some of the best production I’ve heard in a while. Not many songs on it that I don’t likeIG LOVEThe new Avengers made 650$ Million in just it’s opening weekend.  Avatar is about to get its record smashed by the Marvel Boys 😍😍😍@jennybabejenjen Knight*@jennybabejenjen Have you scene the Dark Night Trilogy?@7AnthonyDagher7 This is what makes people not want to contribute to your cause. It’s not a cult, it’s a movement. You care more about whether someone commits to the idea of being vegan than the actual cause at this point.Just cause I haven’t seen you for 4 years, doesn’t mean I haven’t forgotten about the stupid shit you’ve done to people I care aboutHelping my friends move is actually just what I needed. Helping friends through big life decisions, is what friends are forInfinity War was by far the best Marvel Movie ever released“Artistic Meeting” AKA Smoking WeedWTF KOREA TREATY AND ABBA REUNION IN ONE DAY?No Social Media till I see Infinity War Tonight 🤷🏽‍♂️@_RiotWenceslaus Omg, where did you get this?@BarbadosSIim Juno, but it’s not like that less impressive anymore with the amount of Canadian Artists running the industry right now.@BarbadosSIim The Weeknd is one of the biggest artists around bro. Blair, my Studio Teacher, Engineered all of his stuff minus his new EP. You can’t tell me people who’ve been in the industry for 20 years, through all the industry changes, don’t know what their saying.@BarbadosSIim A Metalworks grad literally one engineer of the year this year...Leading arts school of Canada...@BarbadosSIim The older generation are the people who choose who make it onto big session. Getting the tools you need to be on par with the industry leaders is step one. Having sub par software isn’t helping yourself at that point@BarbadosSIim Well my profs work on most of the big artists that are around. The Weeknd, Arkells, The Hip and such. These guys got some good credentials. They aren’t just talking out there ass. Forgot Metalworks wasn’t the Industry 😅@BarbadosSIim Lotta people wouldn’t even get there tracks listened too because of it. My prof won’t listen to anything but PT and Logic Sessions. Tons of pissed off ableton guys.@BarbadosSIim I don’t think people in the industry would look at an FL User the same as a PT or Logic user. Wether it’s a respect, a trust or a doubt thing. I wouldn’t trust someone who works in FL to mix my track. Cause it’s not what it excels at.@BarbadosSIim I understand that DAW’s are just Tools. Using the best tools for you’re craft is something everyone should aim to achieve. Limiting your ability to do something based on how well the tools are presented to you is a problem in itself.@BarbadosSIim I see how it works for hip hop or R&amp;B, it would not work well at all for recording audio, or any type of group audio recordings. It’s for making beats, and I understand that, but a DAW is for more than that.@filmakesmusic True true! I was thinking the opposite which is my b too. 🤙🏻🤙🏻@filmakesmusic In terms of mixing and mastering capabilities atleast@filmakesmusic And bring them in a DAW for mixing. I understand where your coming from. Producer just means different things in our heads I think. Outside of Hi-hop/Trap/EDM the daw really struggles to keep up.@filmakesmusic Making beats and being a producer are different things. I think FL is good for people who want to create music from scratch. It just isn’t a mixing/production suite like the others. It doesn’t do anything post-creativity. You know? Most people export their printed tracks from FL@filmakesmusic Sampling is only easy cause the daw basically runs on a sequencer@filmakesmusic I hear FL stock drum sounds on almost every TO rappers tracks. It’s just overused by people who don’t know the depth DAWs can provide. Using stock sounds and presets isn’t producing. Being easy to use comes at the cost of depth@filmakesmusic It’s like the toys r us DAW to me@filmakesmusic The core concept yes, there are 100’s of things I can do in PT and not in logic. Same with Ableton, Reason, Cubase. The only thing FL does uniquely is Gross Beat, and I can get a plug-in for  thatFruity Loops is the stupidest fucking DAW in existence. Invest in some proper software if you want to be respected as a producer.I understand where Kanye is coming from with his stance, but it’s completely hypocritical to what he’s preached all his career as an artistI think John hit it right on the nose Ye, not interested in the new record if you’re “free thought” comes at the expense of others rights. 💁🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/JvMTeA6jYwKanye was saying some woke shit earlier this week, and now he literally just spiraled into the opposite of the things he preachedWhat a completely shit week“Turn your broken heart into art”Listening to the new J. Cole and I’m pretty impressed with how minimalistic the singles are compared to the rest of the record. Usually the completely opposite with big albums.Would love to just fucking relax for onceConstantly moving from one anxiety episode to anotherWhen people realize Writers Block is the default position for song writing, it all seems less stressful. Ideas are things you have once or twice a session, not constantly.Half finished/ half assed / half heartedHonestly I’ve shelved so many projects and songs I’ve worked on cause I don’t think they turned out how I wanted. Probably gonna open a Soundcloud for all my demosTaking those extra steps to reflect on the art, is what gives the art power/substance.I feel like music is just used as background noise these days to whatever your currently doing, spend 3 and half minutes JUST listening to a song today. Nothing else. Feel it, hear it, evaluate it. Which part do you like, why do you like it?Music is one of the few non-physical things, we describe and evaluate with physical qualities. Music has texture, it can sound rocky, it can sound dense, it can sound round, it can sound ominous. So many ways to talk and peel about a piece.Not many people listen to music these days. They hear music for sure, but listening is the idea of processing the information your given. Breaking art down is the whole point of the art itself. Think about what your listening too, listen to the textures it has!Everyone’s finishing school, but I got another 3 months in Mississauga ☺️@RonDonRon Exactly, this is what Ontario needs. We can’t rely on the 401 forever, that shit is garbageCardi B has made her way into my playlistshttps://t.co/RWCFLgDwAGWhen your roomate provides you with culture: https://t.co/fzieyktMzhWtf Avicii Died@FayrosaMya @RonDonRon Lmfao 😂👌🏻What if I told you Arbonne isn’t Entrepreneurship 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 It’s literally a pyramid scheme 😂Kanye inspired me todayI’ve changed what I wanted to do with my career like 5 times this year, but I think I finally got a solid planThe UAD Satellite looks like a necessity at this point thoughNot sure if I should invest in analog gear anymore since UAD is basically god right now@BarbadosSIim This was an emotional RollerCoaster of a tweetIf your going to be angsty in your room and listen to the rain today, listen to this at the same time : https://t.co/9NPB9uQWKQ@justinep_ 👩🏽‍🎨✌🏻Yo did you know that every dog you’ve ever met was NAKED??Excited for the new Arctic Monkeys Record but I really don’t want it to be another record like “AM”. Chill with the pop, gimme some “Favourite Worst Nightmare” vibes plsI ain’t never run from nothing but the policeAlso Vince Staples is the best Rapper around right now, calling him getting massive in the next yearMy taste in music has been fucked this week. Been listening to Vince Staples, Phoenix and Violent Soho like crazy. The newest Phoenix record is amazing.@_christinees 👌🏻💃🏻@_christinees Invite me next year plshttps://t.co/BOqrcX90S8I think Bojack Horseman is by far the best show Netflix has done. So much to that show when you look past the animation styleIf Adam Warlock shows up in Infinity War I’ll actually lose my shit. Best Guardian of The Galaxy for sureI’m recording Saxophone today, so that’s interesting kinda@will_i_am_Berry REEEEEEEEE@will_i_am_Berry I disagreeeeeeeeeeeeeeMonsters Inc vs The Incredibles is close af thoIdgaf, Zootopia is way better than Mulan, don’t @ me bruvI edited music for 6 hours and I only cried twice 💁🏽‍♂️@Raginballs Hopefully!! https://t.co/5pfLeVgcJL@ZackKongdara @seanimrie @ChrisWilliamso4 Neither of them are from the movie@khscar12 @echofoxgg Where can we buy these Jerseys!? Totally down for one@ChrisWilliamso4 @ZackKongdara  https://t.co/xqoDo3BYWAI am actually so hyped for Infinity War. I honestly think it’s going to beat Avatar out at the Box Office after how much traction Black Panther pulled.If you miss high school, you’re doing it wrong“Yo Lunette the clown was hot as fuck”My pet peeve is when you tell someone to do something and they say “i know”. You obviously didn’t know if I had to fucking remind you.@ZackKongdara It’s called art 👌🏻“What’s the use of a Gorilla”https://t.co/DRWsHa42pMCreeping Death by Metallica is the best song I’ve ever seen liveI Don’t Want To Know@ZeCantaloupe #RedLobsterDiscount😍😍😍 https://t.co/itH3A7GvLBNot only is Metalworks the best Audio Production school in Canada, it’s also a Pokémon go gym soooo@TheMilesLuna Go down to him! Make sure you don’t miss himBtw, Riverdale is back on tomorrow night@WynterW For sure, and choose wether they deserve to be in your life. Hard to do it, but sometimes personal growth is more importantBut you can disregard the negative onesYou can’t choose familyI am really enjoying playing through Pokémon Ultra Sun. The game plays like a story instead of a tradition Pokémon game, but it’s still greatShattered the shit out of my phone screen as soon as I got home today 😞Just got out of the shower nice and clean“Can I play some funky weird carnival music after?”🤔🙅🏽‍♂️@filmakesmusic That’s kinda cool, I could definetely see it being used for that. I’ll try to use it a little more and maybe I’ll get into it. Just not a fan of musicians that don’t try to succeed 😆@ChrisWilliamso4 @ZackKongdara Omg Limewire😂@filmakesmusic Check out Landrr bruv, digital distribution is so fricken cheap@filmakesmusic So much potential put in a spot where they can’t grow, except from their competition. Really makes no sense to me from a business standpoint. Demos? For sure. Full Mixed and Mastered Tracks? Whyyyyyyy@filmakesmusic They could totally make it to Spotify, it costs fuck all to get your song on there and you get payed for it. SoundCloud is really just a circle jerk of SoundCloud artists. Tailor to consumers, not other musicians.Art does not need to be controversial to be goodThe only people that use SoundCloud or Bandcamp are the people putting their music on it, your gonna get no traffic on those sitesHaving a roomate that teaches Jazz Vocals is kinda litI’ve been practicing switching modes in my writing since I learnt what it was in Music Theory, and my writing has completely changed in such a crazy wayThere’s no way you should ever wake up a whole house of people for your own selfish reasonsMy biggest pet peve by far is people who don’t understand how loud they are as an individual. Compress yourself bruv@RonDonRon @adamkovic 🙄🙄🙄@adamkovic You guys ever gonna need an Audio guy to make sure your recording audio all the time? I’m Pro Tools trained 🙋🏼‍♂️@ChrisWilliamso4 @justinep_ I’m really not sure on how to narrow down the naming process. Something abstract, yet focused. Something professional, but humble. Something rootsy while modern. Not really sure@justinep_ NO@_kylejordan23 Fuck yeah dude 👌🏻@_kylejordan23 Yoooo reach man, I live near Mavis nowHoly shit, Music Theory just happenedPokémon Go on the way to class is now a thing. #PokemonMasterByExamTimeHonestly, I’m so excited for the plans I have for when I graduate, all I need now is a name for my studio4 Hour Studio Workshops just for Editing Acoustic Guitar 🤔#FoxWinI thought an Entrepreneur is someone who opens their own business to sell their own product?Want to arm every teacher in the United States?

Some amazing visuals, with a great story to go along with. One of my favorite Marvel films to date. Can’t wait for Infinity War now“I smoke darts and run the projector fam”@ChrisWilliamso4 Nah! Apparently he’s seen some crazy drug action since the show, and actually barely remembers any of it.There needs to be a new edgy sitcom like Malcolm in the Middle but with College Students“Punch a Fish, Make a Wish” is my mottoLooking for business space is so expensive 🙃@sjokz @lolesports @RiotJatt @RiotKobe NA Production 😆I’ve been listening to so much Pink Floyd latelyMy friends are all out of the country while I have class all week 🙃Does anybody else NOT have reading week or?@texxyson @grynpyret Why do you look like Satan 🚨Something unconditional would be nice for once@inerolol It’s pretty lame how after all of your success the casters and broadcast team won’t praise your teams hard work. I knew from the day the roster was announced that you guys would have success, keep it up guys!Pretty stupid that we were raised by a generation that relies on word of mouth as their main source of information.Success, Fame and Wealth are three separate things that people like to put together for some reasonNothing is more embarrassing than accidentally blasting Spongebob on your Netflix really loud throughout the house at 1 am@lolesports this is the most intense fiesta I’ve ever attended@JorgeSe12 @ClutchGaming @TeamSoloMid Solo has always been a strong laner, it’s finally great to see him have reliable teammatesMotivating friends to pursue their passions is a lot harder than it should be. You are all 5x more talented than you think you are, self doubt is a brutal thing, work past it, show your talents!“Bare” has snuck its way into my vocabulary@JennybabeJenjen We can wingman each other 👌🏻@ZackKongdara I’ll check it outJennifer Anniston is single now, just gotta make sure she’s not “on a break” before I make my move@ZackKongdara Science Fiction is my shit. I’d like I get into some non-fiction novels but I don’t know where to start“Not every day is good, but there’s something good in every day”I’ve been listening to someone fuck with an EQ on a single track for 15 minutes, he’s doing it through laptop speakers....
