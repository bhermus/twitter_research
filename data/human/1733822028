ESKETIT@snarkhunting @Trump_Regrets That was a month ago. Why are you people still replying@splice After months of contemplation i finally sign up for a 7.99 account just to realize 1 Serum preset is 3 account credits???? That’s a bit ridiculousknowing the people you surround yourself with really care about you is a wonderful feeling. 10/10 recommend@PourMemory It’s poor ethics and a degrading generationWhat’s up with people wanting Tay K to be released?? Do people not give a shit about the people he’s killed and robbed or is that the norm now?@ecast1223 @okaycornell the human lifespan at that time was also an average of 50-60 years. but very good point nevertheless@ecast1223 @okaycornell i didn’t mean to label him anything. my original comment was to point out my observations about his appearance and choices which dictate the essence of his character@sakura_punch @ecast1223 @okaycornell @sakura_punch my last one about concluding was @ that other guy@ecast1223 @sakura_punch @okaycornell i didn’t conclude anything. it’s all a simple google search and article from a credible source away@sakura_punch @ecast1223 @okaycornell he put it on his snapchat@ecast1223 @okaycornell You’re right. How awful of people to misjudge a man with tattoos all over his face that got a blowjob with his buddies from a girl so young she probably hadn’t even had her first menstrual cycle yet. 

Oh can’t forget about the video either👍🏻flu szn@MasonHill20 @Olumide301 @Reeenieweenie @karlquintanilla @ShaliniSpasteez @DevaughnWatson @swampbroad the world needs more thinkers like you@NinersMayne my friend, why are you so heated@watermelonrice @Reeenieweenie @BlackmagicLloyd Side note, but i’m 99% sure i saw you at something wicked bc the thing you were holding scared the fuck out of me... oh drugs@Jzim21 @thisisforfreedl @jillianseweryn bro why do you have to be rude to a girl who was making a joke with her friend?
You realize things you say can affect someone right?@KuloTony88 @daniellecombs_ Little childish or really fucking childish?@_lvmnt07 @karlquintanilla @ShaliniSpasteez @DevaughnWatson @Reeenieweenie @swampbroad Hey, i’m not the one who wanted to get technical, tell that to Karl@karlquintanilla @ShaliniSpasteez @DevaughnWatson @Reeenieweenie @swampbroad Technically it’s illegal to impersonate an officer. The car says houston police... Shall we get any more technical, Karl?@watermelonrice @Reeenieweenie @BlackmagicLloyd that isn’t always true unfortunatelyDon’t forget, suffering is almost always a product of thought@realPissTapes thank youwho wants to go to Arkansas and climb a few mountains w me@PascaleOrianne @BasseyAkwa_ @fellythekid how the hell did that work417 hz will make your soul vibrateIf you go to TXST and lost your Samsung phone last week at some point and this may be it let me know! 

I won’t give it to anyone unless you have the password! https://t.co/xDS3KCqjQb@pickledotcom @EssPatrick @NBCNews Not saying it’s a reason, or justification. My point is just that if kids spend most of their time behind a screen talking to virtual friends, it will affect them, whether anyone believes it or not, in my eyes@pickledotcom @EssPatrick @NBCNews I think it’s a matter of  the nature of the games, and how much time kids spend playing them. If a 13 year old spends 6 hours a day shooting citizens in Grand theft auto you cannot honestly tell me that you think it won’t affect his behavior or thought processes at all@Bwhitt94 bup sitchNice stadium though.  @katyisd https://t.co/cEBlzoF9wq@QUIXofficial Tell me how tf to meet you tonight@QUIXofficial what time is your set?@nadyaokamoto @periodmovement I don’t know why i am so excited to see that you’re making this a movement; probably because i was homeless as well. But wow, i have never been more excited about free tampons! Lol you’re doing great things, keep it rolling!!!@JODYHiGHROLLER My guy, no disrespect, but the i is before the e in fieldTONIGHT🙏🏻⚡️😭 @QUIXofficialIs this supposed to be their way of infusing a religious symbol into this tragedy to make it feel better? 

If so, the rainbow is a symbol for god not flooding the earth.... not gun violence https://t.co/L2W666HPsf@babyhuey420420 @pouloa3 @FoxNews Also,  rainbow is a symbol of god not flooding the earth again. Not for human death in general. I don’t think the rain is what killed 17 people last week.Pray, meditate, send thoughts, do whatever you do. 
My mom needs it right now more than ever https://t.co/rImFxdax78Why do people like hitting my car in parking lots so much? https://t.co/qXoUfQtfq9@QUIXofficial @kenzie_rose_ If i don’t hear Skin to Skin and hotel Garuda i’m gonna be very upset man@kenzie_rose_ @QUIXofficial i didn’t know it was a video🤷🏻‍♂️See you next week😈⚡️

Where in the world did you get that😂@RealTJones1 @ms39211 His not responding makes me assume he does indeed know why😂America is shithole country. This is absurd. https://t.co/wQ5oSlRRJ4@ms39211 @RealTJones1 What are your thoughts on the shithole countries remark?@ixbgrbm @jeffpearlman Mind your own business bob@JermePhilip feels good to see someone try and bring me down to their level knowing i won’t(-: I feel no guilt if that’s what you’re asking. In fact i feel great, i had a smoothie today and man, do i love smoothies@JermePhilip It would also be better without people who aim to hurt others feelings like yourself.

Hopefully his account comes next😂@nahughes89 @Chrisbdg34Smith Nice job man!! Oh and don’t mind Chris, he’s just trying to bring others down to his level of unhappiness with life. Hopefully he finds peaceWell, i found a cave today👀 https://t.co/qMMcoLVnkx@RegularBlack_ they aren’t, and i’m not disgusted. I’m living a great life and i am joyful every day! (-:@dmboggs74 That’s one way to put it i suppose@sacshavykos It won’t. I have peace with my decisions and mistakes. I am sorrowful that i assisted him, however i was not under the impression it would be this bad. For that, i am sorry.@Chrisbdg34Smith Well, i’m not racist, but i would love to visit russia@Chrisbdg34Smith Now that would be something to experience@Chrisbdg34Smith As long as i fly united@KristinaTurley_ these are my exact thoughtscould not have said it better myself https://t.co/KFr6XDk1b7@Serenepaper well, i respect your honesty@PastelNinja @T_FisherKing @DuniganMary @FoxNews @potus45 You are exactly right@realAsteroid we live and we learn my friendly astroid@realAsteroid You’re quite a chatty asteroid@HannahDrake628 @jordansdiamonds i still think people deeply offended by that are soft. Get some thicker skin and don’t take everything personally😃@T_FisherKing @HannahDrake628 @jordansdiamonds I will eat shit and die as soon as possible!@WestIsBestUSA @jordansdiamonds I hope you feel better about yourself Gretch. But i’ve learned that people who have hate such as this to cast on others, are actually the ones suffering themselves. 
Now, without further a-due, commence the hateful comments!@WestIsBestUSA @jordansdiamonds In all honestly, i believe i fit in the lazy category. As it was my first year to vote, i was not as informed as i am now/:@MichaelCarusi Well i’m sorry to hear that man. I’m sure you’re a great guy, we just had differing opinions at one point
