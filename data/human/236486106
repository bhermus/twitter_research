@Se_Railway But WHERE is the conductor? In the carriages suffering this heat too or in the drivers cabin enjoying the breeze?@Se_Railway Tell me this:

Where’s the conductor you referenced to open the windows?

When was the air con checked on this train?

When was the air con fault reported to you?

I guarantee your drivers window is wide open getting a nice breeze!!

IT IS A SHAMEFUL!!! 😡@Se_Railway THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH!! 2nd day running where my train has no air conditioning or windows open. 13:04 from Bromley Sth to Victoria. The carriages are over so packed the body temperatures of everyone makes this unbearable!!@Se_Railway So if the train crew had reported the defect of yesterday’s train then they would have opened the windows as a contingency? And by elimination does that mean the checks weren’t carried out prior to departure? 

I might add the driver’s cabin windows are usually WIDE open@Se_Railway Ok so my question to that is how regularly is the air conditioning checked to see if it’s operational? Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Again, not just yesterday but it’s hot all weekend. You as a company have a duty of care to the commuters.@Se_Railway @Martyn_w The conductors who are ever present throughout the carriages? No I didn’t. They were nowhere to be seen. Why are the windows locked when you - as staff and a company - are fully aware of the weather forecasts? Why aren’t all windows checked before they leave the depot?@Stuart_PhotoAFC @MirrorFootball I’ve made it a point not to give them their click-bait statistics - along with The Sun and Daily Mail. They’re all stained with the same vile brushHi @Se_Railway your 14.22 service L. Victoria to Canterbury West has no air con in operation. To add to this, the 2 windows available on each carriage are locked and require a key to open. In case you’re not aware it’s currently 22 degrees outside.@lwleonw 🤦🏻‍♂️@AndrewDalhouse We’re booked in for a 17:00 viewing. Just keep 🤐 till then...please? I promise I won’t moan about Mourinho for the rest of the season 😬@AndrewDalhouse Tomorrow 👊🏻@Martyn_w @charles_watts @arseblog @1Gunshow @slimpikkings Of course, but a 5 minute cameo at some point this season before he leaves will be what we all want to see@charles_watts @arseblog @Martyn_w @1Gunshow @slimpikkings@AndrewDalhouse I guess we’ll agree to disagree. This is the beauty of the sport, different opinions invite a debate...maybe there should be a debate room setup for this sort of thing? 😜@AndrewDalhouse He had an impressive squad that year he won the league, but to oversee those 2 as surplus to requirements? It’s ok to admit mistakes, it takes a big person to do so, but I doubt he would admit he made a mistake. Do you think he’s handling Pogba, Rashford and Martial correctly?Am I the only one who sees this comparison? #BradFriedel #Thanos #Marvel #InfinityWar https://t.co/mCyWiVWbRd@AndrewDalhouse It hasn’t taken them 5 years, they’ve continued to improve year or year since leaving Chelsea. They were simply given an opportunity to play after they left@DeadlineDayLive Imagine thinking Danny Rose is worth circa £60m-£70m!! https://t.co/G7WcXuorJXI know many people have said it but never forget Mourinho once sold the current PFA Player of the Year and Runner-Up for a combined £33m 🤦🏻‍♂️

He also has both hands around the throats of Pogba, Rashford and Martial. Unreal talent that he has no clue how to manage@TNLUK You know what they said...3rd time’s a charm!

Sprinkle that good luck dust my way for tonight 👌🏻@AndrewDalhouse Saturday for me. Literally cannot wait https://t.co/GlrWH11iFUHi @PureGym - how much ‘non contact’ as you delicately put is in your Pure Box Fit class? I’m recuperating from wrist surgery but am interested in the fitness side of the class. If it’s shadow boxing then it should be fine. Thanks@haywhitchurch Because you’re on your phone tweeting...🤷🏻‍♂️@TNLUK @miss_chicken@miss_chicken FFS. How has NO ONE seen this asshole?!@TNLUK You didn’t sprinkle enough. Just a £2.90 return. That’s a £14.60 loss. Not cool guys, not cool...@TNLUK I hope you’ve sprinkled all the luck in my direction tonight. Tickets purchased...awaiting your good news 💶 https://t.co/X9sbK0zhQE@miss_chicken @TNLUK I won £5.20...still £4.80 out of pocket 😩@TNLUK We know what to do @miss_chicken 💶💶💶@AndrewDalhouse I got nothing but love for Giroud. I wish he stayed. He should certainly be starting ahead of Morata@AndrewDalhouse Couldn’t disagree more. He was first choice striker for 4 seasons and was a huge part in how we played. Bringing in Laca and Auba was simply a new attacking approach. We wanted to keep Giroud but he left for more game time...which ironically he’s getting less ofThis is simply ridiculous. So many mini leagues are being won or lost on fine margins - such as this https://t.co/TPeC1Ebr6SI’m not surprised whatsoever. No need to elaborate any further #CutsHaveConsequences https://t.co/tjinPQtJRA@southard01 The problem is the Attitude Era was so iconic I don’t think they’ll ever be able to match it. It’s why I don’t watch it religiously anymore. Haven’t done for years. The last time I watched WWE was last years WrestleMania!@southard01 He’s looks awful. As does Matt Hardy who looks like a recovering heroin addict found in a dumpster somewhere. So many people now I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♂️@southard01 31 years old, taken a days annual leave to watch it and I’m not even ashamed 😁City have been phenomenal this season, no doubt about it. HOWEVER they’ve now lost 2 games and bottled the chance to win the league against their rivals. Stop comparing them to the Invincibles @SundaySupp@stevejones4497 @ElFrankos1 Agreed - risk management is essential. For example a Swansea-Newcastle fixture would require far less resources than a Merseyside or London derby. Also it’s not a ‘claim’ that the Met are under resourced, it’s a fact - and that’s all thanks to our Government@MadameTussauds You’ve had my feedback. The system is not fit for purposeThe @MadameTussauds #London queuing system is not fit for purpose. There is no point booking a time slot when you’re left waiting for over an hour past your time. Sold on false pretences. Should be told “book your ticket but be prepared to wait 2-3hrs”@southard01 Happy birthday buddy, have a good day 🎂 https://t.co/MvFlYSUhT7It’s that simple. https://t.co/fRhjc1wvMTPutting more sweat on Stoke’s relegation chances puts a smile on my face ☺️@SkySportsBoxing Absolute beast!@johnflood81 @Spotify Spotify wins every day of the week@johnflood81 @johncrossmirror @MirrorFootball And before someone digs me out for criticising a Spurs player, their star players this season have been Kane, Eriksen, Son and Dembele. The rest have been somewhat average which tells you how well those 4 have done@johncrossmirror @MirrorFootball Which has been non existent all season. The one season wonder tag was applied to the wrong Spurs player. He should be nowhere near the starting XI based on current form@Coral Neither@footydebateroom I agree. I see this as just mid-season transfer nonsense to fill a gap. No way Arsenal would remotely think about paying that sort of money too!@footydebateroom discuss! Can’t see it happening at all but talk is Griezmann is imminent at Barca,  Dembele hasn’t settled in Spain and wants to reunite with Aubameyang? https://t.co/sPKLNjxr5q@AndrewDalhouse @NetflixUK 🔘 How To Get Away With Murder

Should have stayed at Spurs 🤭 https://t.co/9zwdrHFjxdWhat a KO!! 💥🥊 #WhyteBrowneSo, so disappointing from Lucas Browne thus far. Slow and lacklustre #WhyteBrowneDereck Chisora absolutely schooled David Haye and Joe Joyce then. Love it #WhyteBrowne@AndrewDalhouse If there’s one thing we will always win it’s a twitter poll https://t.co/JHDKoLwG1K@FootyAccums Down:
West Brom, Stoke, West Ham

Top 4:
Man City, Man Utd, Liverpool, Chelsea@IanWright0 @johncrossmirror He’s implying Danny Welbeck in the first Englishman to dive in a game of football and has tarnished English football forever. No one has ever dived before so this is a hard pill for everyone to swallowWatching the #WhyteBrowne #TheGlovesAreOff and it’s clear that one man is calm, relaxed, talks openly and confidently.

The other looks confused, lacks trash talking, tries to be funny but isn’t.

For me, I’m backing @lucasBrowne to win by KO@johncrossmirror @gunnerblog I challenge you Mr John Cross to do a spread in The Mirror that calls out ALL the dives from this season across ALL Prem clubs. Yes Welbeck is included in that, but will you be big enough to call the others that got swept under the carpet? #DeleWelbeckLove this 👌🏻 

(Cc @footydebateroom) https://t.co/M7gz3pfuEI@Carra23 You’re not the ONLY person to blame. Yes you did wrong and you’ve accepted that. That said if you weren’t being goaded and if dad wasn’t being an irresponsible driver on the motorway just to get a video then all of this would have been avoidedUnlikely I know but I do wonder if @GNev2 would tell Sky Sports if @Carra23 goes then he goes too - very much like Hammond and May did when Clarkson was in hot water with BBC?

No way Sky Sports could run the risk of losing both!@27Arron 100% - we all have a limit. We’re human. Poke a bear with a stick enough times and he’ll bite back eventually@27Arron I hope he keeps his job too. Suspend him for a period of time and let him come back. He knows full well it was wrong. We all do. JC apologised to the family for dragging them in to it, but if dad wasn’t filming on his phone whilst driving then they wouldn’t haveI can’t agree with this enough.

What JC did is the lowest of the low. There’s no denying that and he’ll be punished.

But take a step back to think about the actions of dad here. All to goad a famous person and catch it on camera? He can’t come out unscathed https://t.co/nVXnIBwVYQ@arseblog @gunnerblog @danleydon I know he only plays on a rotational basis, but how impressed were you with Elneny?
I thought he provided great balance in midfield, made himself available at all times and dare I say it - played some key forward passes! #ArsecastExtra@AndrewDalhouse How did Troy Deeney get on today? 😉@AndrewDalhouse  https://t.co/P7ntKj2L5JGiorgio Chiellini

What a man. What a legend. The voice of the people #ForzaJuveThe banter era continues 😔

Has Wenger been sacked yet? https://t.co/ba7Dhy2x2R@AFCAMDEN @Arsenal If that’s the case, does that spell the end of Ramsey’s Arsenal career? No chance he’ll sign a new deal if being punished for this@OfficialFPL @LeroySane19 🙋🏻‍♂️Hello @alzheimerssoc when are you next doing a collection day in Bromley? I’d like to volunteer@debbiee__x And Bromley 😔I’ve just called and spoke to your customer service team - even they have stated that it’s a new system but I may still need to provide these same details NEXT year? 

When you implement change, it’s supposed to make this easier. Not harder.@arseblog @gunnerblog Is there ANY scenario where Wenger leaves before the end of the season? #ArsecastExtrahttps://t.co/l1oLYL9tQv

The perfect 10 second clip to summarise yesterday’s performance...and this season in general@DannyWakeling9 @LBofBromley It’s unbelievable.

They’ve contradicted themselves on my scenario as they say “Have your circumstances changed?” No. “OK, which evidence will you be sending?” 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️Hi @LBofBromley...YOU have sent US a parking renewal reminder letter, however you STILL require evidence despite the following:

1. My wife has lived here for 7 yrs
2. I have lived here for 6 yrs
3. We’ve owned our car for 4 yrs
4. We’re on the electoral role

Please explain.@Martyn_w @debbiee__x @virginmedia We’ve been with Virgin for about 4 years now. The old TiVo box was poor but we’ve recently upgraded to the new V6 box and it’s very impressive for all the reasons Martyn said and more@sammorgs88 Danny Welbeck looks like that kid at school who never took his bag off for a game of football at lunch time. Fucking dreadfulInteresting view from a Utd fan here @footydebateroom https://t.co/VIcJmJIEOU@Arsenal how many retweets for a signed shirt?I find it funny that despite @MatchroomBoxing clearly promoting the fight as #BellewHaye2, @mrdavidhaye himself on his own social media is promoting it as #HayeBellew2 😂

💬 “If you oblige me @TonyBellew we’ll do it on your terms”So...2 part question:

1. What is the correct order of all the #Marvel movies/series?

2. What’s the best platform to watch them all on?Only in America 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/Gr5fKV4Vh4@AndrewDalhouse @FootyAccums I agree in that respect, although it doesn’t matter if they’ve fallen short of trophies as Poch doesn’t seem concerned about them 😉@AndrewDalhouse @FootyAccums The balance of?@AndrewDalhouse @FootyAccums Does that not scream lunacy to you? Yes every fan wants their team to play attractive football but ultimately it’s about trophies, no?@FootyAccums So he wouldn’t have swapped with Utd of last season, playing dull football but ultimately winning 2 trophies? 

Yea. OK. 🙄@EPLBible Your Thelma-like running technique is as ridiculous as my attempt to get the ball@southard01 I can’t help but hate, I wish we had DDG. Best keeper in the world@southard01 £175m for DDG, £25m for PogbaThis is why I no longer give these morons* their click-bate statistics. What absolute codswallop 👎🏻 

*includes Mirror, The Sun and Daily Mail https://t.co/w6cAVk7ydS@AndrewDalhouse @Arsenal The same standard you were playing just 12 months ago 😉I’ve had an email reminder yesterday and text message today (both from @MillerandCarter) and a notification from Google about my reservation tonight...

...safe to say I wasn’t going to miss it 😜“There’s a power shift in Europe” 🙄Eric Dier looks like that stereotypical Year 9 thug who was forever getting expelled at school@ahmedgooner91 Allegri@HunterClockz They started engraving City’s name in November! 😂 they’ve been so impressive this year. 

Arsenal need a major investment in defence and a midfield general. Huge summer ahead

What’s happened to the Mourinho-Pogba relationship? Looks in turmoil from the outside looking inReplace Man Utd with Arsenal and it’s the exact same message from my side (though we haven’t been good enough for a whole lot longer!) https://t.co/jFx8yku60J@virginmedia I’ve called. (Hopefully) all sorted, although not the most helpful of people I spoke to. It required me to ask the questions they should have@virginmedia I’m already a VM customer... could I send you my account number and you check the status remotely?@virginmedia Neither. I said I might be out today so it was offered to be delivered to a local shop. I’ve just had no confirmation of the order from Thursday, nor anything to say it’s been dispatched from you or the courier today?Hi @virginmedia I’m expecting a delivery to my local shop today, however I’ve had no email correspondence since my order on Thursday. Is this normal?Interesting that no journalists have attempted a combined XI again for tomorrow’s #NLD? 🤫@1Gunshow I knew someone would comment, which is why I quoted the lottery tweet with it 😂@YouAreMyArsenal Love th bruised banana design 👌🏻The sad realisation that I’ve spent £17.50 on 7 lines to know I’ll only recoup £2.30 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/ezdy6jxwDv@bet365 Americans don’t even know who Deontay Wilder is, so...

https://t.co/qWPgwdj6RC@ZIYAAD_LFC https://t.co/hMBrGqiQnR@KevNGxx @petebez78 @MarkLoveday75 Initially I thought it was simulation (like the first pen) but I’m happy to hold my hands up and admit I was wrong - 2nd pen is nailed on@MarkLoveday75 Perhaps the 2nd one was a pen...just the theatrics didn’t help! https://t.co/Ld9EyfCdGU@MarkLoveday75 Neither of them were. Officials have had a mare@KevNGxx Also, was a dive?@KevNGxx Re: 1st pen... surely it doesn’t matter if someone touched the ball or not, Kane was the intended target for that pass and he was offside at the time the pass was made 🤔Perhaps the ‘one season wonder’ (now a 4 season wonder 😉) tag got pinned on the wrong Spurs player...Dele Alli has offered Spurs nothing since his breakthrough season. 

When Lucas Moura is fit, he’s the obvious choice to be dropped.@HunterClockz I can see Iwobi dropping to the bench and a midfield 3 of Xhaka, Rambo and Jack. Front 3 of Mhiki, Ozil and Auba

Defence needs MAJOR work in the summer!@HunterClockz Let’s hope the new front line can help pick up similar results for the remainder of the season to bridge the gap! No room for setbacks nowNot even a close decision for the lino there. Clearly offside but a well taken finish by Auba 🙌🏻@arseblog @gunnerblog With Per retiring at the end of season &amp; Ozil signing a new contract imminently, would you like to see us go traditional with shirt numbers in the summer:

#2 Bellerin
#3 Kolasinac 
#4 Jack
#5 (new defender)
#10 Ozil

#34 Xhaka (not so traditional) 

#ArsecastExtra@southard01 I just wish people, especially the media, would stop trying to defend it. It’s ok to say “yes it is a part of his game, he has a tendency to do that” - did Rooney get the same protection at Alli’s age? I don’t think he did...Is Dele Alli still “not that sort of player”?@arseblog That seems like smart management to me? Breaking (roughly) even on the wage bill when tying down those 3 for the next 3/4 yearsCan someone, anyone, explain how Andre Ayew has moved for the same fee as Giroud!? 

Absolutely fucking scandalousWith Per retiring at the end of season and Ozil signing a new contract imminently, I’d love us to go traditional with shirt numbers in the summer:

#2 Bellerin
#3 Kolasinac 
#4 Jack
#5 (new defender)
#10 Ozil

#34 Xhaka (not so traditional)Was a tease!! 😝 https://t.co/z30EdDurGZ@arseblog Imagine we pulled the deal like they did with Demba Ba?@AFCMet Like they did many years ago with Demba Ba@SheWore And the ©️ armbandCech will never get that 200th clean sheetIt’s hard to applaude but that’s a snip for a top attacking midfielder https://t.co/jKLD2nHNKw🐐 https://t.co/j1uOrCHvKf😬 https://t.co/Vb85EUdwxZThis would be the greatest announcement ever https://t.co/cjUuSmZUZf@myhermes I DM’d you at 11:47 yesterday as per your instructions and it’s taken you over 24 hours to respond? You’ll have to wait now (like you’ve made me wait) until I get home@oh_that_crab Not even maximise - just better than what we have been because it’s been piss-poor for a long, long time@JWTelegraph Does he not have a point? Whilst Arsenal/Wenger are slammed for our faults (and rightly so) others are put on a pedestal after achieving what exactly in recent years? Remember when all media outlets were loving “Arsenal 10 years without a trophy” pre 2014? Contradictory@southard01 In the summer I did but now I think there’s a very good chance he stays. I hope he does anyway. I’ll be more gutted if Ozil leaves than Alexis@southard01 Only a fool wouldn’t rate him. He’s world class and will only improve your team. He’ll give you a ruthless streak you’ve been lacking. I accepted he was leaving a long time ago so it really hasn’t bothered me@myhermes Hello Beth 👋🏻 I DM’d you at 11:47 as per your instruction but still waiting on your reply... https://t.co/Xk9mivtqEr@southard01 Don’t be so naive buddy! It’s well reported a £450k wage plus a £15m signing on fee

At 29 years of age it was his last big contract so I don’t blame him whatsoever for choosing Utd@Oddschanger And has done bugger all sinceDoes this knob-jockey not realise he’s benched now? ✊🏻💦 https://t.co/eIE1NmHhIlAlexis Sanchez had 450,000 reasons to choose Utd now, rather than wait and join City or Bayern. 

Anyone with an ounce of common sense can see he chose money over an increased chance of success across multiple platforms@myhermes 4 hours on and still no contact to acknowledge or apologise re: my complaint, despite you clearly being active on your twitter account.

This, if anything, underlines and confirms your level of customer service@johnflood81 @Martyn_w Who will look forward to playing attacking football. Mourinho ruining yet another attacking talent🔴⚪️ https://t.co/q7lfhIC3xG.@myhermes I have just witnessed your driver make no attempt to ring 1 of 2 doorbells at my property and instead stuff the parcel behind the dustbins. When I challenged her she was incredibly rude. This is NOT an acceptable service@LBC Yes.@btsportfootball Hey @LacazetteAlex - you know what to do 😉@HunterClockz Mkhitaryan is a very good player. Happy to get him in return. Jose the reason for Mhiki not producing what he’s done throughout his career. 
Alexis will definitely give Utd that ruthlessness you’ve lacked for a while@1Gunshow As an Arsenal fan it’s instinctive 🤷🏻‍♂️Arsenal were once 4-0 up vs Newcastle and drew 4-4. This one isn’t over yet #ARSCRYVery good goal by Chelsea there 👏🏻@southard01 That’s because both teams are polar opposites...one attacks and one defends 😉@theowalcott @Everton Good luck Theo 👍🏻@miss_chicken Not in my eyes they’re not 😬@27Arron I’ve not seen Alexis linked with Newcastle?@sammorgs88 Usually the idea of signing any of Mhikitaryan, Malcom and/or Aubameyang would get you excited...but with AW at helm all that excited is gone@sammorgs88 But alluding to your earlier point, until Wenger goes its going to be the same shit but different players. He HAS to go!!@sammorgs88 We’re happy to sell RvP to Utd
We’re happy to sell Alexis to Utd
BUT we’ll block Debuchy’s move there? 🤔

Everyone at the club, especially Wenger, Gazidis and the board should be ashamed of themselves@sammorgs88 Arsene Wenger has completely undone the legacy he built at Arsenal. He’s going to leave the club in a worse state in which he found it. The sooner he leaves the better
