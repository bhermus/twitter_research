Unless you can download it from Xbox live or something@Succinct_Punchy Probably like all of them. The ps2 is generally the slowest of the three. The question is actually 360 vs Wii. That generation of console hardware is hilariously irrelevant for most speedruns.@Succinct_Punchy God damnAnybody else ever just like, think about the Goodburger movie?@TheSuperSNES I find there is an abundance of dull moments here. The weather is what spices it up@AlucardX60 finally@bradnthings @2dosSRL defiant users are people who intentionally get hit with intimidate. in other words, they are easily baited https://t.co/vsrc2oUATp@bradnthings @2dosSRL sounds like someone who is easily intimidated@Beneziaa Is there a word for a group of lesbians?Big news for @bradnthings https://t.co/3TWWY5RVZ7@mwoogle ill probably be busy, idk@Beuchiism one of my favs, have fun!@CullenJake13 I put up and tore down a very large stage today, so that's my sourceI am sore@KazooieGirl Dabu di dabu daiI was so not prepared for my film class devolving into looking up rule34 of The Babadook, bit here we are.1. 2

It's only natural that the least liked game to the blind masses could be uncovered as the best one by my trained eye.@iongravirei What do you mean, you've known me for years@AaronS_Lambo  https://t.co/f9z4r3kQLB@AaronS_Lambo i knew I felt a disturbance@Hennejoe @Succinct_Punchy  https://t.co/w0UFbqNLvs@Succinct_Punchy Fair@bradnthings This is just like, the general opinion.@Succinct_Punchy Why would you take a horse?Final Fantasy 12 is the best FF for the sole reason that it is the least like a jrpg; which as we all know is the most vacuous, derivative genre in all of gaming.

The kicker is I mean this about vanilla too, not just zodiac. https://t.co/h09tFRmLtQ@thegrygor @bradnthings hold on, Ill show him how its done@bradnthings Do it@ToniichanP I'll get ya when I get home@bradnthings @ToniichanP @iongravirei Imagine someone who hasn't lived through  Suramar hell thinking they can use meme arrows at THE brad@ToniichanP We are horde, but I have alliance characters to level@ToniichanP Play with my gf and me, what are you doingMy girlfriend claims to have drawn a thick half-naked Yui without ever having seen K-on, or even this charcter.

Instead of "I play everything BUT" you get "I ONLY play fps, jrpgs, nintendo" ect@bradnthings Plenty of time to play fallout new vegas@GoldenSRL sonic advance@nukkulareaction Aesthetic@CullenJake13 @PacSun edgy@CullenJake13 @PacSun the cutting edge of fashion. 
In that, you need a cutting edge to open up the pockets /@daizawazawa It wasn't a mistake@JessePajamas NoPosing looks https://t.co/pi61rUGRM8Oh yeah, the picture https://t.co/dtFtZTC5hqOh course I just had to take @eelspeike to H hotsMillia_but_you_pressed_X_instead_of_O: the figure. https://t.co/CwKgbEZU85Tora con is pretty cool (I bought figs...), but it is so weird walking around RIT for the first time in almost a decade@nukkulareaction She's in the best Sonic game, so it's a strong claim@Snowfats same@EggmaniMN WorthMyself and @eelspeike felt like going to tora-con, so I'll be making my long awaited return to RIT this weekend. Woo!
If anyone in the area wants to hang out, gimme a shout@nukkulareaction &lt;3@nukkulareaction rip@eelspeike  https://t.co/6AryF5rmFb@bradnthings i literally dont understand why people use ambipom when cinccino exists. And nobody uses Cinccino because it sucks, so...@bradnthings for yourain is worse than snow, come at me@flickyish I didnt know your name was Chip.
Because if it is, I probably have.@nukkulareaction grats memeganI have to wonder if my French text books are giving me an accurate picture of France. I'm skeptical that I could order beer, a ham sandwich, hot chocolate, red wine, ice cream, and Orangina at every cafe.I am a natural model. https://t.co/0ufr6MBJsc@nukkulareaction Okay memegan@bradnthings try it yourself@bradnthings nobody wanted him because he was so small, but the small girl loved him so he got big@eelspeike @WillOspreay @steveaustinBSR But honeeeeey@WillOspreay @steveaustinBSR @eelspeike look at ospreys hand@Shadow_Jacky https://t.co/gKnXd4oUD3@KittenFiddlers That's too bad, bit yeah keep on touch@KittenFiddlers Yeah I am.

Also meet your boi cavemanI have arrived at Boston. See y'all tomorrow #PAXEast@beuchichan half life 3 confirmedNo game in for SGDQ, which is not surprising given that I have literally not done a single run of anything post-AGDQ, and really don't care to. My focus right now is on volunteering, and that's what I was accepted for. It's all good.@KittenFiddlers I'm skipping the line this year my man, but I wouldn't be opposed to meeting up somewhere less cold@altabiscuit oh my gosh he is already @'ed at paxwho are my pax pals this weekend?@Warcraft yeah, why do you ask?yeah ok kid, but how many FFR tokens did you have?@unusualcook @LiquidSquid_ üëçSound Bois https://t.co/J9uaeExnVK@ToniichanP And everyone else should too.@ToniichanP I'm always lawful evil in these things what does this mean@nukkulareaction aww@Succinct_Punchy I do that every time, and now I don't stream anything and just play wow.

If it's yall, great!I haven't mentioned this, but I'll be at PAX East this year again. This is a great opportunity if anyone wants to meet me, take a pic, buy me fancy cakes, or just hang out, for anyone who happens to be there. 

Oh yeah, also come to this https://t.co/u2ZnSdgES1@Brossentia Not that kind of mold you goof@LeonPowSRL I'm getting custom fit ear plugs, which will hopefully add some longevity to my career in live soundEar Molds are happening https://t.co/9iflgicWrP@Lastpall_stream yeah I think @Jorf__ did some runs of it a while back.
It looks like a sick game, its on my short list.@kariohki Whenever you feel like coughing, try to swallow instead. Coughing is the worst thing for your voice. You can also try to surpress the cough with deep breathing.How were kids even affording to eat tide pods? Those shits are expensive. I'm lucky if I can afford a watered-down shot of arm and hammer@itsyaboiclaud Only the best can handle the best@mecharichter do you like rice?@ToniichanP you never told me you could play the drums!@Succinct_Punchy Evil Zone did it best. cant have infinites if you don't have combos check mate m8@LiquidSquid_ @Succinct_Punchy Honestly I found the original ps1 parappa to be off sync too, so the remaster is probably pretty accurate. People say lammy fixes this issue, but I'm not in a huge hurry to play that@Succinct_Punchy No that's pretty accurate. I own multiple copies of Rayman that I've never beat, and parappa sucks balls@bradnthings not getting any drops from seige of orgimmar@eelspeike Honey that's a scrubulon@bradnthings rip@bradnthings what happened@bradnthings did you discover this personally@eelspeike oh my god you got different glasses@kelseahalloran yes actually 
https://t.co/Wn9ouqaj6MI dont have any pictures of myself from 2012 because I was a bedridden pile of shame and depression.
I also don't have any pics from 2018, because I don't take pictures, but things are pretty okMaking NL8s. Connector 1: Super Happy Fun Time.

Or you could cosmic brain and get TWO PSTVSI don't care if no one watches, I'll stream what I want to stream.
Incidentally, thats WoW right now.stram.@Keizaron In that case, as your friend who cares, please live life on the edgeImagine going home and discovering that in your absence someone or something has stolen all of your Blue-Eyes White Dragons. @eelspeike wants to play TRAG, so we are streaming that. What could possibly go wrong?
https://t.co/S5a57PGlC4@Scrumplet Hope you have fun with it, it's a pretty straightforward run@Scrumplet yeah I cant give you an exact window, because I dont have one lol. Just try attacking right before you jump, youll get a feel for it@Scrumplet yeah, if you attack at a particular frame, your attacking momentum will get carried into your jump, making you go faster. You can also chain these together, allowing for potentially limitless acceleration. Try it out somewhere else straight, you should do it every jump of the run@nukkulareaction noted, looking forward to it!@nukkulareaction yoooooooooooooo@Keizaron Hang in there man@Cyclo_EU Right thereI don't actually expect any of these to get in, just fyi.@IHNN1 thanks, will do@teapartycthulu ive used that before¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø https://t.co/bkYE0hhwtrdoing No Major Opinions tonight in 5.
