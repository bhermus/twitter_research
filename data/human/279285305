That’s why I stand by my statements about Piers Morgan and Donald Trump. They are both c*nts. 😂@strallakind212 Swearing is almost essential in a Scottish conversation. And to be honest, it’s very rarely I use it in a derogatory way. Mainly just to emphasise a point 😂@strallakind212 Americans are a bit funny about that word. It’s day to day vocabulary in Scotland!! Can even be used in a a complimentary term “Oh yeah, Dave, he’s a good cunt”. People are so touchy.Well this was a new experience. Fail to see how I broke any of these rules to be honest. Cheers @TwitterSupport https://t.co/1RKCL2PS1o@the_pieface When they’re giving this as a goal you know the game’s gone. https://t.co/l10wCvavE3@flaresnseagulls She’ll live tweet the whole ordeal I’d imagine 🤮Airing after the watershed as Piers will no doubt be performing 60 minutes of full blown fellatio. https://t.co/RSMwLWrfAd
