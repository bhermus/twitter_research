@bevclack Thanks Bev@laurencepbaxter @antoniabance @OxLabourCllrs Thank you Laurence. A truly devastating day, but I will bounce back.  Such happy times especially when we were buddies on the patch.Calling round talking to Quarry residents who were pleased to see action taken on dog fouling. Just down to one or two owners sadly.@Innkeeper55 @LabLinda75 @quarryrovers Sad. The hedge was planted by children including my daughter about 25 years ago.  Will be pressing for the hedge to be re planted after the development is finished.  It was planted with the support of OCC to provide a wildlife corridor through Quarry@AnnelieseDodds Colouring in is so relaxing!!@QueenVicMirror Great to see Rachel Walding explain the fantastic work they are doing at a Pegasus with families@oxmailnathanb But apparently residents of North Oxford drive to Headington to shop at Waitrose....#shocker@O2 what is your policy on graffiti removal on your utility boxes? I would suggest you take a look at every one of your boxes in Headington OX3 starting with Windmill Road, which would suggest you haven't got one!@LeonardoLoredan @maryoxford I would be more impressed if they were 'shocked' at the level of rough sleepers in Headington.  Wrong priorities.@theamprevival Anneliese Dodds MP has confirmed a visit! Women of Quarry and Risinghurst - your opportunity to meet your  MP and ask about her work in parliament and as a mum of two young children @AnnelieseDoddsAnother morning in Risinghurst hearing from residents and finishing off at the Ampleforth @theamprevival.
