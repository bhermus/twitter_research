That's Kenya for you.@sirjnrbob @OdongoStevour @16 As a follow-up, what's the rationale behind changing the number of units purchased per monthly top-up. Seems like an issue of poor contracting to me if the token service is outsourced.@GylineM1 @Classic105Kenya Also, communication is a two way street. If there is failure then its a shared responsibility not completely the woman's or man's fault. At least that's what we should all live by.@GylineM1 @Classic105Kenya True. But then it seems that the solution was there all along. What is starting to become clear in most marriages is that it more resembles employment where you can be fired for not performing according to expectations. We are no longer seeing each other as human beings.@bonifacemwangi @PoliceKE @NPSOfficial_KE @JBoinnet Please expound on "falsely". Are they arrested without evidence or ...The world is currently divided into two groups. One is leading us into ruin, the other knows where we are heading but won't help the situation and are waiting on the sidelines with their marshmallows not knowing the whole house will burn.@CheriJacobus @gmarieee @biblioventures @Miss_Jaslene How are you even verified. What ever happened to courtesy. But again this is twitter. Sigh.@KimKardashian I never thought I would see the day when I agreed with Kim but here this is 100% right.@Classic105Kenya Men are starting to wake up to the realization that they are just success objects to women. Once your purpose is done, you are thrown out like a used tampon. Keep a close eye on your money and fulfill your passions. Men are also human beings.@GylineM1 @Classic105Kenya If the story were reversed and he had a reason to leave... Would you stand by his door vision to leave you because you are unable to provide@CLINT0NDANI @Classic105Kenya @ItsMainaKageni I agree. I've heard of the law in the manosphere spaces.

It is 2018, with Kenya having 52% female population, equal opportunities for education and pursuit of one's own passion. This is just politics. I support equal opportunities, not equal outcomes.@VictorMochere True, but not without strategy and use and development of tools, which is where we go wrong as Kenyans and as Africans.😂😂😂 https://t.co/k7jGCr1wTo@MikeMondo1 @terrymuikamba Marriage is not for men. Men have alot more to lose from the agreement and from a purely logical perspective, there is just no need.@MikeMondo1 @terrymuikamba Marriage these days for men is like holding a grenade without the pin, you never know when it might go off. And when it does, whether you are on the wrong or not, the law is not in your hands. Also, the number of manipulative women has skyrocketed....@StandardKenya @UreportKe Hahaha...... lmao. Literally.@citizentvkenya @Madridude This is just PR. Watch this space.@njokingumi @OzloJemo When you're drowning and someone throws you a dirty rope, you take it. Otherwise if you can avoid it choose your Healthcare provider very carefully and avoid the public institutions for now.@agwatijafire @RobertAlai Texas USA. Happened recently. I think its understandable considering its your child (not advocating for violence though). Damn. Also these days its not hard to find a lady who is willing to exchange blows with you.@agwatijafire @RobertAlai They had abused his kid.@RobertAlai Men, when will we ever learn. Form your own life goals and work towards them. When you talk about their behavior we are giving them attention (which is the aim). Let the lost be lost. Make your life right and get your money. Let people lie in the beds they make. #men #mantalk@terrymuikamba To be left alone.@b0nareri @achiengakena @inakebrown @self_taught54 @C_NyaKundiH No. I never said that. I clearly didn't side with anyone. All I see is two sides talking past each other. The friction generates heat and maybe that's what some individuals want. All I said is to get at the individual on a fact based level.@achiengakena @b0nareri @inakebrown @self_taught54 @C_NyaKundiH (continued) otherwise any conversation just boosts his numbers and attracts even more hateful/vengeful people to him. (our brains are more sensitive to negativity than positivity)@achiengakena @b0nareri @inakebrown @self_taught54 @C_NyaKundiH Again I'll put it forth that many of the criticisms I see of him are about his personality or behaviour. Unless I know him personally I don't see why that should matter. I should expect that in a conversation or discourse, we should be pointing out what's wrong with what he says.@MelGawozi_SA This isn't even a question. Of course ROASTED. :)@b0nareri @achiengakena @inakebrown @self_taught54 @C_NyaKundiH But isn't that just a strawman argument? You tell us his thoughts and speculate where they are coming from and proceed to debunk them. I'm not siding with anyone as today's society is just rotten but if you're going to tell someone they are wrong, at least attack his points.@RobTD91 @jordanbpeterson @Slavojiek I echo these sentiments. Much love @jordanbpeterson all the way from Africa. #doyouknowdawei@MuhidiKimsos @C_NyaKundiH Worldwide things are changing. Hopefuly in #2019@nurucoin_crypto Pyramid scheme.... Please keep away.

Jesus....@Shinebosire @Classic105Kenya @ItsMainaKageni We are all human beings but whether we are men or women, neither of us can escape reality.@Shinebosire @Classic105Kenya @ItsMainaKageni The problem with double standards is that they cut across. Sometimes it's in favour of men sometimes women. But there is always some biological origin to the statements. People should not get so easily offended but take time to reflect on their lives and how they want to live.@Classic105Kenya @ItsMainaKageni Before it used to be 30 now it's 27 and coming down. Will be 26 by the end of the year. There is a direct relationship between the age and inflation.... 🤣🤣😂@danielmarven @ItsKwamboka A. They don't exist
B. When they say "let's make our future" it usually means "you go and make my future"
C. Even if she won't ask for money, it will be implied
D. See section A@MirikauFredrick I'm not on either side as they are all thieves but aren't you doing the same by using general classification of the "celebraters". Who are the "members of kikuyu community"?@VictorMochere Boss.... Spoken like 15 people.@C_NyaKundiH Hahaha.... Nice...@StandardKenya @UreportKe I stopped taking the @UreportKe  section of this paper seriously.@kipskiplagat @Classic105Kenya @ItsMainaKageni @MwalimChurchill To say the truth, I agree with you bro. These ladies want to come to your house and consistently be like an exam invigilator asking you where the money is going without any understanding of where its coming from. Kazi ni lipstick, outfits, makeup tutorials and Nairobi Diaries.@STEPHEN__254 @Classic105Kenya Kayamba kwako bro. 🤜🏽@Charity04544721 @ItsMainaKageni @Classic105Kenya Even something as "trivial" as your lifestyle affects the genes that you pass on to your child. A healthy life doesn't just concern the woman. Nuff said.@Charity04544721 @ItsMainaKageni @Classic105Kenya One thing women choose to look past is that due to biology, the woman has a heavier burden when it comes to such matters. But irregardless of sex/gender if you make your bed, be ready to lay in it. The consequences of your actions are inescapable. Someone always pays the price.@mwixzip @itsndungunjoro @ItsMainaKageni @Classic105Kenya Hahaha.... Ati advantage. That's inviting chaos to your house.@muchwelucy1 Hahaha.... That's a good joke.Tweet of the Year 2018. https://t.co/5VlFF3pzEu@kennaz_ Truth 👌🏽👌🏽🤜🏽@danielmarven I don't know what degrees you are equating with diplomas but you are sorely mistaken. Even the scope of learning and specializations are different.@AnthoniaOrji Actually that's the very definition of science. Laws and predictability. Any spontaneity and randomness only results from our limitations as human beings and our tools. The rest is just philisophy and politics.@jobomosa @tina_teesh @C_NyaKundiH Have seven on me bro 😂😂😂@ntvkenya @tonyswaka Fake media. You are like the child that goes hurling insults at the big kids then run crying to mum when you get whooped. #cleanseourscreens #MediaShutDownKE #MediaShutdown@ntvkenya You guys are such drama Queens. Now you expect the public to fight for you. Go to court, not social media. #MediaShutDownKE #MediaHousesDramaQueens@kenyanwalstreet So 2000 employees accounted for the billions that is the 10% or so gap. Also these are 2000 vs the millions of Kenyans who are losing out on opportunities. The few cannot profit at the expense of the many.@KBonimtetezi Go back to your bulls.
