And the games we had in the lead but then lost in fourth quarter. I can’t say that’s the athletes fault. I would say more coaches than anything.@JaredGambell13 @MoneyMitch_44 So you’re saying the cowboys don’t have talented players?@JaredGambell13 @MoneyMitch_44 I always question if you’re a cowboys fan or just a Romo fan bc if he won a super bowl, you’d be the saltiest cowboys fan there is bc Romo didn’t win 💀😂@MoneyMitch_44 @JaredGambell13 It’s gonna be an interesting year. That’s all I know@JaredGambell13 @MoneyMitch_44 Oh I did. It’s not possible that draymond does more than lebron. Bc he’s been that way and whines, and travels all over the court 💀😴@JaredGambell13 @MoneyMitch_44 I didn’t compare. All I said was he’s going to win a super bowl unlike Romo who didn’t.@JaredGambell13 @MoneyMitch_44 Lebron been whining since his rookie year. Gtfo with that nonsense 😂@MoneyMitch_44 @JaredGambell13 Next big three- Dak, Zeke and if we draft him Ridley. But they do need to get it together. We also need to get rid of Garrett@MoneyMitch_44 @JaredGambell13 No I have no problem with Romo. None at all. Die hard cowboys fan. But dak is going to do something Romo couldn’t and that’s win a super bowl@MoneyMitch_44 @JaredGambell13 Yes bro😂😂 lebron or Romo. There’s something@JaredGambell13 @MoneyMitch_44 Ever notice when you say something bout lebron. Jared always has an excuse for it💀 that man lebron cries more than anyone in the league 😂Is our boy @EzekielElliott gonna be slimmed down this year like dak or👀Imagine texting your homies like “bro, you won’t believe who’s tractors I got. They’re Scottie Pippens!”
