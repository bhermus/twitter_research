Protest, make your voice heard. #atlprotest #atlantaprotests #blacklivesmatter@Galatic8bit @ajc yes I did.

This type of thinking is the problem. https://t.co/iQYlhFxIOt@DallasPD take this tweet down. Show some respect #dallas@MajaMajorLeague I live in ATL &amp; am horrified by what the black community is going thru. Hope to help bring attention to the issue@MajaMajorLeague to be fair he did launch an FBI investigation into itI'm only a white ally and I can't stand this. I can't even imagine what the black community is feeling. Please accept my solidarity #dallasThoughts are with #Dallas tonight. So many peaceful protesters, yet violence takes the main stage. #BlackLivesMatter@baguettewhore absolutely - this has come out since I originally tweeted. Thank goodness there is now an FBI investigation to find the truth@ST7757 none of these facts negate the fact that racism still exists and there should be an investigation. Which there will be #piedmontparkThank you @KasimReed for being pivotal in the launch of an FBI investigation into the #piedmontparkhanging #piedmontpark@Kwitchabichen25 I'm not familiar w it, but if it's a similiar case of a black man hanged in the South w little investigation, it's relevant@Kwitchabichen25 happened this morning https://t.co/7qfihGXS4r@pevans4uga it happened this morning https://t.co/KZPtWEIPzX@fagmoney this kind of rhetoric is dangerous if you don't have proof. Demand proof but don't create it@PunkinOnWheels I feel like everyone is just waiting for the ball to drop.  Everything is vague as hell@PunkinOnWheels ive been tweeting about it all day. Absolutely nutsTo the media who has decided to report on the #PiedmontParkHanging, thank you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you. #PiedmontPark@M3gzz_ https://t.co/uzQWccHPUgNo, we don't have all the details in the #PiedmontPark case.  But yes, the man's race is relevant.  The South has a disturbing history.@savannahhraine @rnbnamjoon @ajc kindly remove me from your mentions@savannahhraine @ajc because when hangings in the South are involved...race is relevant.  Even if that is uncomfortable.@ajc why not mention his race?@ShaunKing have you seen the tweets about a black man hung in #PiedmontPark? We all need answers@BreezyCastilleo It's thinking that the June date is a typo https://t.co/fV2NgVRTyZ@soundtracktoKy this is chilling@niche @JenBrettAJC don't think it's a hoax, just a typo https://t.co/LtAKJ6FFh8@theatlantavoice it has been confirmed by @Atlanta_Police https://t.co/m8a95BRVAG@KasimReed do you have any info on the man found hanging in #PiedmontPark?@KillerMike have you seen the tweets about a man found hanging in #PiedmontPark?
