@ELSock @RealCaustic@ELSock @WatchMixer didn't realise you were Canadian?! ðŸ˜‚@RealCaustic@ChantyBooty most welcome@ChantyBooty do what?! Looking good chick.@CohhCarnage  Thought you would appreciate this. https://t.co/k81NGTliy6@RealCaustic @OttawaFuryFC Wait... aren't you supposed to be a nerd? nerds don't sports ya big dummy.. :P@OldFlads heroes?@ForceStrategy However, If I may, I would suggest purchasing an external DAC and AMP. I have this https://t.co/6Npq73rrRp
its absolutely out of this world audio wise for a good pair of headphones.@ForceStrategy Does the same on mine, there are multiple different types if you look in the audio setting. It basically just auto detects the amount of amplification needed to drive your headphones. 
its an Asus thing, maybe your old motherboard wasn't asus@RealCaustic @theSHEDteam more space to fill....@MistressOnMixer sad though that the pink parts will get all dirty and moist from hand sweat :(@MistressOnMixer there is a joke here somewhere! :P@MistressOnMixer not nearly enough pink :P@Diemyluv maybe you're the type of zombie that's weak to water.. maybe he's super smert :P@ChantyBooty 17.5/10 XD@RaccasGaming Remove the second before placing in the first though.@RaccasGaming One thing you can try is you may have a currupt RAM stick, I've fixed this update issue on a friends PC before by removing a stick, powering it on, then off, putthing that stick back in then removing the other, on then off then putting both back in. Try that@RaccasGaming managed to fix it yet pal?@ForceStrategy oh for sure. for someone like yourself, if you took all those comments to heart then you likely wouldn't be making content at all.@ForceStrategy im not a huge SoT fan to be honest, but rather than being a complete ass about it. why do people like that just not watch the video. if they want Overwatch content there are plenty of YouTubers out there that are OW focused.
*sigh* Internet....@ForceStrategy People think a 20 minute video takes 20 minutes to make. They also believe that you should only make videos about games they enjoy playing.
I was given a ton of abuse back when ESO released for saying it had very poor end game... and I rarely even create content.@ForceStrategy To be fair, if you take away most of that comment you're left with some ok'ish constructive criticism :P@Diemyluv to be fair, if you asked me if I've pooped I'd get a bit offended too :P@ChantyBooty Photoshop! :P@ChantyBooty relevant? https://t.co/hZCGfO2q7M@LonoB So.. MewFour then! XD@ChantyBooty Eerily Similar! :P lol https://t.co/hO3ou2FboZ@ChantyBooty @JasmineJubbles funnily enough I send people pictures of my boobs on my birthday too XD lmfao@KickyWonka what if its SkyrimNewVegas! :O@ELSock Snow... all the feking snow! get away with you and your awesome Wednesdays you massive poo! lol@ChantyBooty  https://t.co/GpiAecADiF@ChantyBooty less than $300 though I bet XD@ChantyBooty sad face. can you not get a US one designed for travel?@ChantyBooty grill... get a credit card... use that and pay it off instantly when you get home.... perfect for these situations as its all insured.@MistressOnMixer Thank fluff no Siege this weekend.. I don't think I could handle the stress from that again! XD G/L with what ever it is you're going through, hope it gets better soon! :D@ForceStrategy Thought of giving ESO another try? went back and had a look at it a few months back, seems like they've added a whole lot. when we played back at Launch was so underwhelming at endgame. seems much more flushed out now.@ChantyBooty the extra height was gifted to the booty! :P lol@CassmTv just before I read it, I was gonna say "what are you doing dressed as Santa, its February!" lolJust a dude/dad that likes playing Vidja Games! https://t.co/a6JiFDjSKk #SockNation #the_Horde #TheShed via @WatchMixer@itmeJP @CohhCarnage @Ezekiel_III after watching the latest Dropped Frames on YouTube and the upcoming changes to the Twitch community guidelines, the grey areas about attire etc. Mixer's rules on the same subject. https://t.co/5YmVPplmH4Just a dude/dad that likes playing Vidja Games! https://t.co/a6JiFDjSKk #SockNation #the_Horde #TheShed via @WatchMixer@OldFlads you need to get your butt back on for some Siege boiii@ELSock @WatchMixer skins still a bit nasty.. but back at work now albeit slow days. but other than that im all good...@ELSock @WatchMixer absolutely over the moon for ya bud. who says you have to be good at games to be a good streamer?! :P lmfao. well done sweet cheeks@LonoB if you haven't taken a picture of a game off the screen at somepoint, are you ever really truly a gamer? :P@ELSock @synn4000 @RealCaustic @UndeadHooligan @bizzomephisto @SploomGaming @_zomberella @MandiisaurusRex @n_phart @Styles_hack What is going on here? what about Synn's Buns? lol@OldFlads will you be gaming next week?@OldFlads Right, finally finished Divinity so i can play siege again now :P@OldFlads ikr lol@OldFlads yeah... much sleeps lol@OldFlads I am waked lol@KickyWonka 10/10 IGN@OldFlads @goblingee I am on now.. in TeamAwesome discord, got 2 others I think so we should have a full team.@OldFlads @Rainbow6Game super we shall play@OldFlads @Rainbow6Game Noice.. I have to hop out to work for about an hour and a half... will you be on around 4:30?@RaccasGaming Excuses!ahhhhhhhhh Yeah! https://t.co/0t9bKGwkCW Much Hype! @stargate@OldFlads I would strongly advise against such action... Apparently, its still half assed.
However if you wish to partake in some R6Siege... I am playing that again with Kanito and others.Cohh's Razer Kiyo Giveaway https://t.co/aGu7UrPvvQ@RaccasGaming Either that or "You look better in many small pieces" :P@Diemyluv ironically that is also the face you'd make in the morning following Spicy food@OldFlads it is in progress :P@OldFlads Long ass drive, 5 hours there, an hour on site, 5 hours back, I was dead!@OldFlads shit lol@Diemyluv Form'a'phobia.... :PIf someone would like to buy me a Vive so I can play @fallout 4 VR... then please feel free to do so XD@OldFlads I was surprised when I was down there yesterday that you had nothing, we have loads. So much so that my boss just text me saying if its bad don't bother coming in.@OldFlads Yep. Too much@OldFlads Travel lodge or something similar. And  I'm in Deal@OldFlads what about Friday? if I can manage to get down there at a reasonable time Friday? couple of beers before you have the kids? or do you have them straight from work?@OldFlads I am down Kent to do some work on a School but it will likely only take an hour or two, was thinking beers, i will likely be down Friday and stop in a hotel so I don't have to drive Saturday morning@OldFlads what you up to next weekend?DIRTY! https://t.co/VnxbEshyv8Two Hundred and Forty figgin hertz. !!! https://t.co/4EXPO0SudN@OldFlads Well, I bought a new monitor, back to good ol'1080p but it's 240hz. Should get it tomorrow@OldFlads If I understood french then that still probably wouldn't have made sense. But I take it as a no hahaha@OldFlads Le'Games tomorrow eve?@ELSock You may be my Daddy but you ain't my Dad...... Eughhh lol@ELSock You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my dad! Ha@JoshDrew94 @Sllayt3r Are you employed by UPS or agency, as I have spoken to a few agency workers that do a similar thing (not for UPS) and from what they said it sounded like they are worked extremely hard for low pay.@Sllayt3r dude seriously, its an issue because no-one wants to work the absurd hours they make their delivery drivers work, I mean think about it, they deliver between like 7am-10pm not to mention they have to get the vans loaded etc. all for pretty much just above minimum wage. sickening@OldFlads Ok so that 500 hp buff that alex can give... turns out you can give it to the whole team... just not alex herself.. OP OP@OldFlads its not a massively long journey either, I think its about 4 hours 5 at most.
when we next speak I shall give you the details.@OldFlads No dedication!!! Hahaha well it's something to think about you can always stop with me I have a spare room. Or he also has a flat to let too.
Just an idea as I know a while back you were looking at jobs more north.@OldFlads Well it's Stafford and surrounding areas but yeah pretty much lol@OldFlads Also was it you looking for a joinery job or were you looking for someone else? It's a bit far to commute but I went to a house today who owns a joinery company and they're looking.@OldFlads Ahhh buttttt alexstraza is out today!@OldFlads Haha. u on tonight?@RealCaustic @WatchMixer @theSHEDteam @thehorde_ @ElSockNation @DesolarTV @RBMixer @SwordofPoke @tigwyk @BeBluntGaming @dragynslair @WolfzheaD @ReaperFist19 @LiLLady915 @ELSock @UndeadHooligan @_zomberella @Rival_Laura @Seven_of_7_ @lehariplays  https://t.co/ee5P3j0Di8@OldFlads I am about good sir.... jump in the discord if you can@OldFlads We need to get some gaming done again soon bro-ski, where you at?@Diemyluv getting beat up by your kids now....
