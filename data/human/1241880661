Legit cried when I read this 😥 https://t.co/KjOiWj4H1zI just knew that today was gonna go to shit 🙃
Just get me home.This is the 6th allergic reaction I’ve had in 5 days why is my body so shit 😅So very excited to see my family tomorrow, it feels like ages since I last saw them💓💕Pls watch 😂 https://t.co/iIlCYUUMVKFeels https://t.co/1n1oYEOAASActually can’t get over how much I am in love with my boyfriend.
After all the shit I’ve finally got someone who has a beautiful soul, and an even more beautiful face💕 https://t.co/O4WBrm5w3dHe is so adorable https://t.co/CyZeeWNLuYUni is meant to be the best time in your life but I’m sat here starving with £8 to my name, and enough stress to power a nuclear bomb.@antbully @_mariselavera @_madsgee Holy Jesus 👀Being proper ill at your bf’s when he is also ill is shit. 
I want him to look after me, but he wants me to look after him and neither of us can move 😥I feel this in such a level, my dad almost died because people hate police. All he was doing was his job trying to protect people. Disgusts me. https://t.co/EpdjGGrrntThis makes no sense. The @Marvel Universe has been bringing out introduction films for the past 10years.
Not Marvels fault if you’re a fake fan and trying to start watching the franchise from Infinity War.
Idiots. https://t.co/wKaBHodVgwWhy people such trash. How is he allowed to walk with this cap on? https://t.co/QXkW6lLAtCBeing done with uni work till September honestly feels so liberating@antbully How am I still drunk 😂Just got to keep working till Sunday and then I’m free of uni work for the next 5 months ☺️@DuckAlina Application sent in.I don’t get how there’s some students out there that literally never have any work or do any work, uni is all I ever seem to be doing.Gotta love uni’s double standards.
Lecturers get mad when you don’t check your email every 5 seconds, but take about 3749857 years to reply.Sad to think come Sunday I will never  study Post Colonialism again 😥
Literally spent the past two years having that word be 50% of my thoughts.@DuckAlina Good luck boo!#4forwolverhampton
Amazing opportunity for a place filled with such talent 🎭So excited for the year ahead now.
