Up The O's #LOFC #OnlyOneOrientAbsolutely gutted to hear the news about Avicii, loved his music.

You have power over this city, and at the moment it is failing horrifically. Sort. It. Out. Now.Maybe this will be the year you treat all your friends with respect and not just the ones you want to get with 🤔@pizzahutdeliver Yep I'll do that now@Tesco No problem 👍@Tesco Done 👍@Tesco Your "approx 20 chicken dippers" only had 17 inside, while I appreciate the "approx" side of it, 17 is a bit of a disappointmentAlways accurate Kyle! https://t.co/gHP1BEguvV@energybet_com @leytonorientfc 1-1!Thank you @BaitTech for my Clubman prize! #MatchFishingAnother absolutely fantastic win! To get 7 points off of Tranmere, Fylde and Chester is huge! #LOFC #OnlyOneOrient@hiitsleigharna 😂😂😂😂😂 go make your caesar salad@hiitsleigharna Not sure they'd be sweating too much in 20 degrees though 😉 tbf i fav your tweets bc of your pretty face 👀@hiitsleigharna Pal some parts of scotland wont exceed 20 degrees all year round 😂 Braemar for example.. 😉@hiitsleigharna 2 out of 29k, both of which probably live in Scotland and don't know what 'being hot' is 👀@hiitsleigharna Think you're the only one 👀@sean271289 @RedbridgeJP Sean, i have accurate information from up to last summer but never fished it in the winter. DM me for info if you want itDanny Rowe 0-1 @macauleybonne #LOFC@GeorgeSessions No problem! Was also surprised to read Semedo is playing under Cavasin! And wouldn't of known any of those details without you, so keep it up 👏🏽👏🏽@GeorgeSessions Let's see if he does the right thing.. I've had him muted on here for a good while now. Keep up the good work George, I shared your stat with my Dad and we were both amused to hear how he's getting on!Thought @james_brophy94 was class today, real attacking pace and always looked a threat! #LOFC@thedamongray SportBible tomorrow, you heard it here first!@thedamongray You've made it big mate 😂🙌🏽@DanAuton2590 I'm disgusted in myself and lack of national league south knowledge 😂👀Nice to be right about something 😂👀 #LOFC https://t.co/OnytjWaG54Happy Birthday to the big man @georgeelokobi! #chop #LOFC@OrientOutlook I'd consider this one done, saw him at the Haringey borough friendly with Ling and Edinburgh welcoming him on this "great opportunity"!@FCHTOnline Pitch inspection? Think you might need a defence inspection 😛😛😛 #LOFC@Daniel_slaw Credit to you for making that journey, bring the points home! 🙌🏽@Ilfordfcfoxes @ronsampson15 @Arsenal @SpursOfficial @WestHamUtd @leytonorientfc @HackneyWickFC @essexsenior You clearly haven't seen our pitch recently then 😂😂👀@DanAuton2590 Didn't look familiar at all, looked around 20ish, could be a loanee for all we know! Sure we'll find out soon!@DanAuton2590 Nope didn't think anything of him! The guy was sitting with his partner in the stand 👀Witnessed Lingy and Edinburgh welcoming what looked to be a new player who came to watch tonight.. "It's a great opportunity for you" ML said.. Possibly expect a signing soon.. #LOFC@georgieorient 😂😂😂😂 my mistake 👀Well this is one way to spend a Tuesday night... #LOFC https://t.co/DiLxJbWxoV@FCHTOnline @Dazpigsy Then use your covers as a precaution you tinpot idiots?! Can't be that difficult to work out! #LOFC@ginaprisca Thank you! ☺️@SLeela1990 @rocks1883 No segregation so can't tell, roughly half of the gate at a guessThought @rocks1883 had a cracking little set up, a good pitch and gave us a warm welcome.
