Fouls hurt teams quick.If the Pacers breathe or sweat the refs will call foul against them for the Cavs.Pacers v the refs smh!Remember folks NBA playoffs is different from regular "we dont care"  most of the season. 

Real coaching, a good bench, and defense is needed as the game slows down.Anytime you play the Cavs and Lebron its your team v the refs also.
