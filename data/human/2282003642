@nuddypants 27/4. Friday till Tuesday #short #betterbewarm@nuddypants Have a good one, Mel. Don’t use all the sun up, please 😂@dylan10100 @gianthalifaxrt @TrainSharp @TrainSharpJon @PedalPotential 👍@The_Nick_S 14 minutes 23 seconds. Or sooner. Piling down here now 😩@The_Nick_S 🤦‍♂️@ds12kbw @lionelbirnie @guardian_sport From memory, @willfoth covered dates/details in a piece shortly after the original story broke. Not seen it anywhere since, oddly. Could be wrong, but I’m sure there’s a link somewhere online.@MosesTom @teamjltcondor Have a good one, Tom 👍@andyleigh95 @tourofantalya Have a good season, Andy 👍@robwscott98 It’ll do you good, Robert 🧘‍♂️@Leon_Gledhill 👍 https://t.co/1917JevfKd@LuAl22 @richtaylor1984 Generally, the same. Sometimes a little smaller on TT, depending on geometry/rider.@jamesward01 @rosschapman @use_exposure I’ll second this, for similar reasons.@3RTCycling Will discuss with El Capitano @fitcip 👍@3RTCycling @BritishCycling @danstocchero @Force_GB @AlbionCycling @DaveRaynerFund @marc_etches @dean0downing @PrologueCycle @BarnsleyRdClub @OOTScyclingclub If you want a ‘great prize’ like last year’s great prize, you’re welcome 👍@6t8 You can never beat the headwind though.@6t8 Nah, I was just turning up Woodhouse Road as you were dropping down on the main road. Went back over the Edge.@6t8 I think I saw you riding out of Tod. It was quite soggy further west!@GiantHalifax @gianthalifaxrt https://t.co/MuLER3oga2@LuAl22 @chrisfroome Funnily enough, I had just seen that and thought about you!@MrCMMC The EVOC bags are excellent and a bit more manageable than a hard case.@nuddypants @UKCycleChat Pro Cycle Hire just up the road in Port Pollenca 👍@DanBiggles22 @EwonSprokler @JacobTipper @VeloUK Loving your work here, Dan 👍@shley_marshall It’s just the aero ones; a standard Rotor ring  or something like a Praxis works fine. Sale or return?! #sorry@shley_marshall I believe the aero rings don’t fit. For that reason. Stand to be corrected tho.@VeloUK Jenson Young?@The_Nick_S The wonders of West Lancs?@Sharp1ie The new Shimano would fit the bill; maybe RC7 for winter? If you fancy something different, Lake are wide/plenty of volume.@Leon_Gledhill @GabzCullaigh @LeeBoyBrown @JimmersBrown @felicity_16 Have a good one, Leon ✌️@robwscott98 @OfficialWIGGINS I thought they’d asked you to leave for a moment...😉@LuAl22 @robhayles1 @richardmoore73 @cyclingtips Some twitter folk seem to hate everything, tbh 😂@LuAl22 @robhayles1 @richardmoore73 I read something from a specialist today who described that idea as ‘science fiction’. Think it was on @cyclingtips I find it hard to believe they’re still knocking out transfusions in hotel rooms.@LuAl22 @robhayles1 @richardmoore73 He’d have to have been mad/dumb to take an oral dose given that he was 100 per certain to be tested. Whatever happened, that scenario doesn’t make a lot of sense.@aegisdesign That’s exactly what it is. I’ve found a couple of 1 1/8, but no 1”. Tried SJS, Spa is a good shout though 👍Attn bike shops/collectors of obscure spares: Does anyone have an M:Part A:Dapter to convert a 1” threaded Shimano headset to threadless. Ideally silver, but that might be being fussy #spares #cycling #obscure #slimchance #nochance@Leon_Gledhill @Joe_Evans1996 @DaveRaynerFund Have a good one, Leon 👍@Spagforth @TeamSky It will run and run. Hopefully there in the spring. My ‘training’ partner has some family issues, so no dates yet.@Spagforth @TeamSky Exactly what I thought! 😂@Cor_i_nne Nutters who manufacture placards without being able to use apostrophes should be on the list.@DaveRaynerFund @John77Smith @tomsoutham @McLAYDan @wegelius @timkennaugh @Ride_Argyle @teamjltcondor @VeloUK @johnherety All work for @Vaughters@andyleigh95 @MarekEngels Looks great 👍 I prefer the seat pin on this one too.... #round #nonslip@MosesTom @letouryorkshire Rock hard, but spectacular.@jamesward01 That is a brutal day out.@MJS_67 @MosesTom @letouryorkshire Rochdale might get 50 metres.....@MrCMMC @Sharp1ie @sportivephoto Think second wheel might be on a 19, judging by his expression.@Sharp1ie @sportivephoto No one on a single chainring either....@nik_tweet @77Ness Shayne Hayne was a strong contender until he retired.@Tasty_Burger Me too....@CYCLING_SHEFF @marc_etches You’ve got a good one in Louis 👍@nuddypants ‘Generally’ 5-10mm lower depending on the saddles and the terrain; more technical riding, slightly lower. Shoes/pedal stack will be different too. Check crank length and factor that in as well.@willboyes An ‘expert’ panel. Expert in what? 🤦‍♂️@fitcip @spatzwear Wore them with tights this time as well #good@4ChordsNoNet Cleats, foot support, twisted pelvis, LLD; any or all of those.@millsphysio Keep your ears warm as well #bonus@PelotonPhysio That’s a good read, thanks. Big issue is dealers/riders rotating bars/hoods up to shorten reach, ruining wrist posture and causing issues.@Alice_Staniford Get some Balmosa from the pharmacy? Works really well for me, worth a shot if you’ve not tried it.@fitcip @tombarras123 @spatzwear You could have got dressed first. Some things you cannot unsee 🙈Very pleased to see @Jakerscott14 finding a good home for next year. https://t.co/wx25PZ9ODv@JacobTipper @willfoth @TeamKGF @TrackWorldCup Great idea and a good story, well told 👍@JacobVaughan14 @VeloUK @Cyclepowermeter Ah. Fair play.@JacobVaughan14 @VeloUK @Cyclepowermeter rent Powertap wheels. May be an option?@Alice_Staniford @KinesisBikes_UK Ah, you didn’t mention that! Nice bikes though, proper guard mounts, loads of clearance, handle well.@Alice_Staniford Kinesis 4S?@BenoirTW Is that a stem with a slight rise? #scenes@Re_carb Out of interest, which manufacturers ‘put together really well’ in your opinion?@k27bro @UkTriChat @UKCycleChat @GiantSwansea Spacers inside clamp, place back on top of mast, torque to 4nm.@charlotte_runs @UKCycleChat You're not far from Adrian at Cadence Sport at Barton. That would be my tip.@LuAl22 I've looked, briefly 👀@LuAl22 @charlotte_runs @UKCycleChat For comparison, I charge £160, which includes @Sidas_Sport footbeds and takes circa 3 hours.@charlotte_runs @UKCycleChat It can be, but I'd definitely find a recommended specialist fitter rather than the first bike shop on Google.@LuAl22 @robwscott98 Always #cortado@AlanBarton6 @jamesward01 Imps mountain TT, club event. Still dumb tho. Lights are red? Tough.@nik_tweet @nuddypants I just saw 'big watchy thing' 👀@nuddypants Is that what @nik_tweet has?@The_Nick_S Thanks, Nick. Appreciated. The bike should be worth the wait.@Sharp1ie Are they Rapha?!@fitcip Remember him and Bartoli bar to bar on La Redoute the year he won Liege. Incredible riders, dope or no dope.@nik_tweet So suspicious 🙄@Sharp1ie Hope it's gone well, Jamie.@AlanBarton6 Gives you somewhere to have a rest, I guess. It is bloody annoying though.@LuAl22 @VeloSkin Aye, close.@BenoirTW 😂👰@VeloSkin Indeed. MSR, Flanders or Roubaix seem more likely starting points tho.@VeloSkin That's a big prediction when he's not won any. Huge talent, obvs. Maybe needs to make better decisions tho 🙈🙄🤦‍♂️@VeloSkin I'd actuallly say Moscon is pretty much impossible over that parcours. Which means he'll probably win. Yates looked good as well.@VeloSkin Allaphillipe.A little indoor climbing for @gleddy123 daveraynerfund @TomMurraySports @flidistribution this… https://t.co/eBSvWZVWeW@A5HLEYbrown Sensational game. Sport at its best 👍@TeamWheelguru @Bennypygott1995 THE Benny Pygott? #comeback@LuAl22 @Cyclingnewsfeed @fitcip 🙈@ColinASturgess @Jake_womersley Ideally, C40 a la Camenzind in '98 worlds. Realistically, you'll get a nice 'Dale for less money.Get that into you #bosh https://t.co/75qlM6L2BU@LuAl22 He would have had time.Progress has been made @Jake_womersley 👍 https://t.co/3MQuyLERKq@LuAl22 Talent of a generation that kid. Incredible.@nuddypants If it's doing it now, it's less likely to do it again when you're there #optimism #percentages #fingerscrossed@nuddypants Have a good one. Fingers crossed for sun!@LuAl22 If you have a 28 on t'back, there's only about an inch difference to 34/25.@LuAl22 Addict.So much sense. If anyone can change the way cycling is used as a form of transport in this country, it's this man. https://t.co/YXR55k4DASIs this on your patch @Chris_Boardman? Unsure what they're trying to achieve here. https://t.co/6BCai0kTDL@MrCMMC I've had no issues with the Exposure TraceR over 18 months.Loving your work this week, @Jakerscott14 👍 https://t.co/vTXMytm0v8@BruceDaltonCX @HannahPayton23 Find the correct Kinetic thru axle then just use any non DD trainer #simple@MrsRHurley Someone has had a good hiding. https://t.co/MxaEmdpJOJ@wheelsmithUK They look great. I'm hanging on for Exalith :)@VeloSkin I seem to remember buying a very loud alarm clock.@Jakerscott14 All the best. Hope it goes well 👍@Tricpj No eyes as far as I know, just a specific clip on. Don't quote me on that though.@MrCMMC @Tricpj @condorcycles One to add to the list. Still not enough of those bikes about #winter #propermudguards@Tricpj Only Kinesis or Mason tick all those boxes, I think. But Giant do some dedicated guards for the Defy.@teamphmas @Tompid @juniortourwales Love a good tape measure 👍😂👍 https://t.co/KsSVlV4IYH@BruceDaltonCX It's got a BSA BB. Rejoice.@BruceDaltonCX Second hand Gaggia Classic and matching grinder. Should be do'able for sub £200. Very good espresso with a bit of care.@VeloUK Well done @LuAl22 @3RTCycling 👍@BenoirTW No worries at all.@BenoirTW There you go 👍@BenoirTW It takes lever shape and bar shape out of the equation.@BenoirTW I use a functional measurement; tip of saddle to back of hoods, where the 'web' of your hand would sit on the hood.@BenoirTW That'll be where the issue is, I guess. How do you measure your reach?@BenoirTW I need some more wine. Basic Q, but are all contact points identical on both?@simongueller1 The only way to spend it. Enjoy what's left of it.@Sharp1ie Classic Orange Prestige? 👀@NBlesic @DtonCyclingClub @KTMBikesUK @firthcycles @IanCammish @VeloSkin @PacelineCycles Brilliant, Nik 👍@AnPost_CRC @Jakerscott14 Good work, Jake 👍@nuddypants I'll DM you.@nuddypants Aiming for long one, but not run since spring so work to be done.@nuddypants Not yet, was planning to tho. Toss up between long or short route!@nuddypants Thanks for the reminder. I'd better do some actual running too.@NBlesic @TeamSwiftTT @KTMBikesUK @firthcycles @PacelineCycles @IanCammish It's finally on the road 👍 Hope it was 👌@DanShackleton @ABCCentreville 😂@Jake_womersley Good luck 👍@suz_guy @Spagforth @Sharp1ie Sounds good 👌@suz_guy @Spagforth @Sharp1ie I need to be back in Mallorca. Missed it this year 😐@Spagforth @Sharp1ie @suz_guy Time for another holiday, David?Go @robwscott98 🔥 https://t.co/ASL4puPoeHYou'll be missed, @willfoth One of the few national journalists to really understand the sport. Thanks for your contribution. https://t.co/HvBSMh1dyi@LuAl22 @robhayles1 A guy once came into the shop, explaining he'd been 'lactating' during a race. We never let him forget #milkThere are lots of things I find satisfying about this job. Clients winning, in Louis' case repeatedly, is one of them #talent https://t.co/gBJrjTpBVf@Stubbsy92 That points more towards the feet, I would say. Although these things tend to be cumulative, so change not necessarily a factor.@Stubbsy92 Could be a variety of things. But check foot stability/knee tracking and saddle height (too high).@james__fairbank They don't want to defend Landa in yellow, just close enough to put pressure on Aru/Bardet. Final TT suits Froome more.@JulianWall2 @letapedutour A friend of mine is 47.....!@MosesTom @itvcycling @SimonYatess There is a reason for that #lancashire@The_Nick_S @Sharp1ie Second that. Wide rim, good to build, stiff and light 👍@Tasty_Burger Carnage.I hear there are some excellent prizes.....! https://t.co/l8bRx9gg50These Watchfinder TdF ads are brilliant #hairylegs #saddletoolow #10grandwatch #200quidbike #wrongwrongwrong@chikkinnugger @NapD @Chris_Boardman Forks were Chris's own, I think. Base bar is on the fork crown.@BenoirTW Completely not necessary, but much appreciated all the same. Thank you 👍@BenoirTW A lower front end is not always more aero. Variable according to physique and head position.@BuccaneerJen Closer to home, there may be something at Tameside circuit?@BuccaneerJen @Cor_i_nne @Pedalsportclub She'll be along when she gets a moment 👍@BenoirTW Your bars are low anyway? I'm guessing your head may be stuck up, catching the breeze.@BenoirTW There are a lot of factors in play. Too many for 140 characters!@BenoirTW Either road conditions or you are less aero, which is entirely possible.@BuccaneerJen Mrs @Fit2R also known as @Cor_i_nne has run a beginners ladies session @Pedalsportclub Not sure if there are any more planned?Top work @MosesTom #allabouttheshoes #footbeds #sidas https://t.co/iUgg1VR1Hr@WendyPreston My favourite.@LuAl22 Interesting one that. Some firepower for the climbs though.@LuAl22 Ah. I'd say they would want another rouleur in there though. We'll see.@LuAl22 Stannard?
