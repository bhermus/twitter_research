Despite being shocked by the backwards thinking, I don’t understand why these people are so hateful to a former president and teenagers. Whether you are conservative or liberal, there’s no denying the blind hatred and insensitive of these tweets. https://t.co/jGk5B1xth1@apocryphon__ Same question@apocryphon__ Did you get this from a fortune cookie?@Ami17han Oh that’s so on point...and yet here I am with Joan and OrinI got Joan Callamezzo &amp; Orin! https://t.co/lq9GLWbhZ6@reese_brown7 @sammyd__19 Yeah like wow I didn’t even know this is what I needed in my lifeThese aren’t even comparable.... https://t.co/4CYkkuk7TmEva’s mom (who’s a doctor): “I hate when people ask me to look at their feet...I’m like ‘can I look at your butt instead?’”My Electronic Design professor really just roasted our class #nochillwhatsoever https://t.co/6TQwz8JFUFDo you like my background, @apocryphon__ ? https://t.co/VT2KuXUIG7I didn’t even know I needed this in my life. https://t.co/GUM8FSOSWn@joshuapolanski @Ami17han Unfortunately I was bannon too 😂Is it bad to use a metal fork to cook?@JohannaBandana @senseileskee @xxscao This literally looks exactly like something we would have done a while back 😂If Lassiter and Juliet don’t end up together I will be v sad@justinmaas100 @pitchforkfest Dude I need to see tame impala with you since we didn’t get to the first timeThis is the most civilized interaction I’ve seen between two people of opposing political views discussing the responsibilities of policemen and their guns. https://t.co/4780WwXMvwThis article may as well be titled “You run faster when you’re cold and scared” https://t.co/9C9QYBOienPsych is so wholesome@GWmCurrier For Orthodox people during Lent, we call that a Friday👍👍👍 https://t.co/4D812ZQNKN@apocryphon__ Lmao I don’t know why I do thisThe album “Offerings” by Typhoon is a 10/10When I get my own dog, I’m naming him Burton Guster.If you’re less than 5 or greater than 10 you’re wrong https://t.co/708LvhFX7MOnly V day post worth looking at https://t.co/0SibwdcGrM@Dr_Clafdaddy @joshuapolanski Yeah it’s all pretty similar, but I’d like to hear what issues you think we have (I go to a Greek Orthodox Church). Although I think I know them coming from a Protestant background. I just think most Protestant people have misconceptions about it (I certainly did for a long time)@joshuapolanski @Dr_Clafdaddy Of course I mean big O, but even though Orthodoxy started in the East there’s an Orthodox Church of America that practices the same way but is not technically Eastern Orthodox.@Dr_Clafdaddy If you’re ever interested beyond that like attending a church or just knowing more, let me know@Dr_Clafdaddy Have you looked into it?@Dr_Clafdaddy But orthodoxy still exists. It’s the closest thing to the original Christian  church, if you’re ever interested let me know@Dr_Clafdaddy Modern Christianity vs the original church I.e. orthodoxy@Dr_Clafdaddy Talk to me@gabetchambers4 Oh yeah I am definitely getting those vibesOk so I’ve only seen a few episodes of psych but let me get this straight:

The police arrest Shawn because he solves a crime then hire him to solve more crimes. He figures out what’s going on and catches the criminals every time, but the police hate him and don’t want his help.Bare minimum Twitter defining “a man” yet again https://t.co/Lq93BpVjQL@mwinerit4 @oliviamhunter GOLD@gabetchambers4 Yo I remember you saying this at chapel hill 😂😂😂@kaitlynnkodzev @PeytonZachrich 😂😂😂😭 wow this is so goodBefore it’s too late- it’s my boy @PeytonZachrich ‘s 21st!

I’m all about lady power, but this was a low blow. How could you possibly feel comfortable receiving an award after that? Definitely tainted their moment that they worked hard for. https://t.co/lz1QJITcXADo you ever just need ONE more bobby pin but don’t have it?LOL ya if my acne looked like that I’d be confident too https://t.co/BbpSvSEPI0@runnersworld Runnersworld has clearly never heard of Airbnb@apocryphon__ Stop 😂😂😭Update: I am wearing two coats. https://t.co/61b6nvkMHmIs it acceptable to wear a windbreaker under a coat so I can fashionable without my coat but still warm outside?@BigWeiss @AustinTodich True facts@sophibabyyy Shrek 2 ❤️@sarahtkline Lmao is this after we went out for a beer?Okay so I’m watching the Benihana Christmas episode of the office and they use 3 different Asian girls that look nothing alike to play the same character in the same episode like lol what?!Friends, please. No one wants to watch a Snapchat of you and your friend clinking your champagne glasses together with the caption “starting 2018 off right” tomorrow morning. So think twice before ya snap tonight.Lol this is my favorite thread. All of these were so on the nose. https://t.co/kDMFvXXjRrHow do you have 4 downs in the 5 yard like against the Browns and still not get the touchdown?Is this game even worth watching? Lol@PeytonZachrich us on salsa night lol https://t.co/VdgEtYdhvKThe way Ron and Harry behave at the Yule ball totally sucks, I feel so bad for the Patil sisters.*filling out job application*

Special skills: I pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing.Like rationally I know that my mother is not going to die if I don’t retweet that meme, but a little part of me panics every time I scroll past one of those bad boysMy ex texted me on Christmas asking if he could have the textbooks back that he gave me at the beginning of the semester even though I need them for next semester and he’s graduating...like no dude, we broke up six months ago. Those are now my Christmas presents.I wish Dr. Richard Nygard was my therapist@Jawiebs14 Why would you even tweet this lmaoYou know damn well that’s a mandrake https://t.co/zWcZDHy9H4Came to the sad realization that when my parents tell me “I’m a growing girl” in reference to how much I’m eating during the holidays, they’re no longer talking about my heightCall me petty, but I’m still mad about the call on the Steelers’ last touchdown against the Patriots last week@cdornback RIGHT this made me so mad. Like Disney isn’t trying to force this LGBTQ “shit” on anyone (also an extremely homophobic thing to say). They’re just trying to represent a group of people who are underrepresented in this world! Speaking against that reveals prejudice!If this isn’t the most “foreign uncle” response to a sliding into ya DMs meme then I don’t know what is https://t.co/EnlXIJA0hU@sarahtkline Can we be friends and drink margs together?My guy friends are the most psychotic people I know https://t.co/MeG86PiU1kI started turning the volume down as fast as possible just reading this https://t.co/CC04kSyk5x@Benstonium @W00DTROY how angry were you when you saw this shit?@PeytonZachrich This happened to me this morning!!@EmPetren Now*@EmPetren Right?? Btw I saw you and Shrey walking onto campus today and I tried to wave from my car haha I felt sad you didn’t see me so I’m telling you know@kaitlynnkodzev Haha apparently everyone else liked them except for me! I thought they tasted like chalkI used to put these under my tongue and then go to the bathroom and spit them out because they are foul https://t.co/Tv2YU4lZz3@JohannaBandana Like even so I think not getting serious until your 30s is totally normal these days sUmm what? https://t.co/MeYnpXrsYh@katewegman oh my god, baby yilmaz was the best thing I've seen all year@m24tressler @heidi_tressler Wow I got “butt” “nachos” and “pot” lmao can’t wait to see what 2018 is likeI’m 110% sure these are strawberries https://t.co/aWGy0OrCv2@Dlux_Resist Yeah but then we would still have Mike Pence so....like literally HOW do people run outside in the snow? I drove from one parking lot to another on campus today just to avoid walking outside@sarahtkline Tweets have been relatable af lately@Dlux_High @politico @wuerker Haha I like that you tagged me in this. Is my twitter that political? 😂@BigWeiss I KNOW IM TERRIBLE.My sympathy goes out to this family, but you can’t say that we are in danger from illegal immigrants because of this one case. Bad people are bad people; and we have plenty of bad American citizens. It’s completely unfair to put all immigrants into this category. Disgusting. https://t.co/Y0tzbSAhb9Literally everything I mentioned had no media bias, they were just actual things that Trump had implemented into the United States. https://t.co/sHzEXCKEgmNational deficit*Wanna talk about DACA?
