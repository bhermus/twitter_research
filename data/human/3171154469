Im Croatian, Irish, and Mexican.So they made Boy Scouts into a gender neutral thing so any person of any gender could join.. and the media portrays this as a bad thing?? ‚ÄúKilling masculinity‚Äù I‚Äôm so sorry your fragile manliness can‚Äôt handle including people and constantly dividing things by gender@Conor_MSP  https://t.co/kpaBAkGW48Answering DMS about intros btw.. they take time so I won‚Äôt be making them for free :// If $10 doesn‚Äôt work for you, just lemme know and we can figure something out.
