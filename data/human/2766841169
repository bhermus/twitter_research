@BDStanley It used to be American beer (as viewed outside America), but I think it’s better known now that it’s not all bud, coors etc@roreiy After 6 to 3am in the ER with my son I sympathize.@latenitenoah @Rob_Tarzwell Basic Instinct or Basix Income?@Samfr Merely a Man - XTC@leftoutside Congratulations!@j4mi3p Funny. Started watching last temptation and then saw this :)@AndrewSabisky Contrasted with my memories of being on the 3rd floor of a building near the towers when they came down, walking into the ash and dust afterwards and at the time not having tv or cell phone and so no knowledge of what really had happened@AndrewSabisky It was so delicately done, avoided being prurient, but didn’t avoid the horror of what happened. I found it uplifting as a reminder of just how human beings can soar.@AndrewSabisky 100%. I remember watching for the first time and hardly believing.@DamCou Chronicles of riddick is good. Though not as good as Pitch Black.@Popehat @SonnyBunch That’s next to the slime / squishes level?@chrisdeerin Ant invasion@chrisdeerin This is hard. Breaking the back of love, or the Cutter@RobStewart_ :) I see it now middle of the back row/second player from left - looking a bit like billy@RobStewart_ Which one is you?@EsotericCD First listened to RAM because of this - have loved it since. https://t.co/Ha5MtHO2bn@EsotericCD @Political_Beats RAM is a great album@Birdyword @jamesrbuk Athens@BDSixsmith Zakopane is great. Don’t know 3/4. No Warsaw? Guess i found it amazing as (a small sliver was rebuilt)@BDSixsmith Essential polish places to visithttps://t.co/TOVgltkQzC@s8mb Some of it is that these people were actually paid more than most people realize. So the jump isn’t as big as people perceive.@notwokieleaks So not let other people’s nostalgia erase your sense of propriety@notwokieleaks Queen = naff. As are all soft rock of the era.@notwokieleaks Queen suck. Always have done. Live aid was bad partly because queen.@SonnyBunch @notwokieleaks The opening scene of blade is astounding@gabrielmalor Wish I had that. I also sweat when I eat things with vinegar which people find weird@SP_Duckworth @michaelglasper @citizen_sane Oh yes. You are so right.@EsotericCD Elves! Which is ‘I wanna be your dog’ with shorty Mark E Smith bits, and when you can’t understand the lyrics might be about middle earth.@SP_Duckworth @michaelglasper @citizen_sane Agree. As it has elves, which is ‘I wanna be your dog’ with mark e Smith stuff on top. And the final words (when you don’t know the lyrics) make it sound like it’s about middle earthUrsula ale Guinn. Such memories. Earthsea, Dispossed, Left hand of darkness. But first and foremost ged.@LemonbeatsCHNL Still take you home - saw them a couple of times here. Including the summer stage. Well good@portraitinflesh Yes. Gets better after first 1-2 episodes which are ok.@b_judah Brooklyn=Rome, West Coast=Constantantinople@Samfr Reasons to be cheerful - Ian Dury and the blockheads@LeithMotive Which one?@DamCou Bit, cyber or e-  maybe smart as in smart-hub smart router@EsotericCD as great as anything out there

As fort Greene where I live and that guy came from has declined and was horrific in the 70’s/80’s. Neighbors who were here at that time wouldn’t go into the park after dark. It started to recover in The 90’s@roreiy But then what do you when Corbyn comes along?@roreiy When I was late 30’s I used to say that “i am the age when I ought to be wrestling with my soul about voting Tory/GOP, but they are such a bunch of shits it’s not a struggle”@GeoffShadbold This one was god though https://t.co/0OlGooixGt@EsotericCD Ridley walker - he ain’t no talker@KevinMFeeney At least it stops the crazier parts of the dems get carried away. Al doesn’t mean anything for mI, fl etc@portraitinflesh It really is quite the projection of power. Very much the effect I think Ancient Rome would have had@LeithMotive Nice hat though!@ExcelPope Is that ‘mind the oranges marlon’?@EsotericCD The Stone Roses - no 1 album from brits growing up that time. Perfect combination of guitars and dance.@roreiy Turkey disappears from shops on Saturday. No set dish for Christmas - have had beef, bbq, duck, goose.

Thanks@bswud Self driving cars with zero emissions will change some of this. Especially when combined with a move to not owning directly@TomChivers The sun set over the pacific is truly different. Completely rad (I am not a suffer, brit born, but it's true)!@sknthla Complexity same. Tolerance for failure completely different. Plane manufacturing is repratable. Movies completely not@shadihamid It's always seemed to me to be an analytical tool. So agree. Not an ideology.@leftoutside Nobly then realized how nuts the UK had gone@leftoutside On way home via Athens and stayed with a friends Greek mom. She insisted we would want to see the funeral being shown on tv@leftoutside Was photocopy of sun or mirror. Really weird as we had no tv.@leftoutside Was in Greece and saw newsstand with black/white headline in paper 'nation mourns' and went to look.@leftoutside God. Was horrific.

But for US in MXP not so sure.@AndrewSabisky @simonraz Tail@AndrewSabisky @simonraz That's the crazy thing - all of them so far out on the tale of performance. But being top 40 earns little whereas top 2 ... crazy incentive@AndrewSabisky @simonraz Farah was a good runner, but not a finalist and then became a winner iirc. This contrasts with Bolt who was top tier from a teen@bswud Nicole Farhi on Bond Street used to be great also. No idea if it's still there.@stephenkb Yes@gabrielmalor Bring the Jubilee by Ward Smith (written 1953) is one that I know@leftoutside Oh and Reynard the fox. 'He spilled his guts all over the@leftoutside Very very good indeed I used to have a 'no trumpets' in rock or pop. That was because I had forgotten how good 'Reward' is@DaveyMelb I haven't.  Looks interesting.Met a man in TN who was part of the Nashville Lunch Counter protest, he had met Lewis and MLK.

First heard from Ram https://t.co/Ha5MtHO2bn@Birdyword Thatcher being elected for 1st time.@roreiy Usual rule of campaigns don't matter, probably broke due to snap election.  Yougov analysis showed 6% swing to labor after manifesto@roreiy Suspect the Tory manifesto was the point when non-Corbyn lab held their noses and really made their minds up.@portraitinflesh Alice in her party dress, she thanks you kindly, so serene@portraitinflesh Eldritch's voice is a crazy instrument. ....@roreiy Quantum irony - existing in a juxtaposition of irony and non-irony.

At start of 3rd@edwest Though iron lungs in themselves a reminder of tough times. People used to to get polio by swimming in a public pool. See story of Ian Dury@stephenkb Modern OS really are just better designed and easier to maintain.@stephenkb This isn't really correct. Problem is older versions of windows just fundamentally unsafe for the internet. The analogy is with 80's cars.@altclassic At the time (12) I really didn't know what this song was about. Naïve 12 year old@KarlreMarks @rtrn94 Brooklyn@mletterle (Or should that be fired)@mletterle Shows they are on fire!!This is quite quite surreal@KevinMFeeney Replacement has to be confirmed. So some checks and balances. Though whether trump knew this ....@KevinMFeeney Of course all the other context means it appears nuts@KevinMFeeney Firing is for last week I believe. On that point alone seems hard to argue against@s8mb Closer. Joy division. Or the wombats, a guide to love ...,or teenage fanclub, teenage fanclub@bswud Wreckin bar (ra ra ra) - the vaccinesTwo hour marathon attempt. Kipchoge ran 4:36 a mile for 26.2 miles.

It sure ain't Corbyn@BDSixsmith How are you legs feeling? Able to go down stairs (going backwards has been done by many runners) :)@EsotericCD In fact they are a one album band. Though never as big as the Stone Roses@EsotericCD And of course this by the same band is wonderful https://t.co/HAOeCxCJMd@EsotericCD following on your riff on selecting a partner based on music choice. Have you heard this song? https://t.co/XaPznvUQVu@BDSixsmith Very cool.@rtrn94 Delirious. So hard to believe after the 92 where labor supporters expected to win@rtrn94 Lived in clapham and watched until early hours, then 5 of us piled into a taxi and headed to festival hall on the south bank@rtrn94 It was completely insane. Amazing night. Campaigned all week. Came home and could barely believe it@LeithMotive Congrats!!@leftoutside Was chatting on this with a friend - the problem is a lot of new stuff is all toppy. No good moving baselines.@bobfrombrockley Scrolled timeline. So hard to tell.@bobfrombrockley Is that account parody?@JakeRudh @altclassic @weddingpresent WP awesome here in Brooklyn last weekend@FinnTD White rabbit - Jefferson airplane@FinnTD Shake it off@FinnTD That is truly embarrassing@MrRBourne But usually coal mining supports more jobs. Engineers, inspectors, retail!!! Etc@kenanmalik Brooklyn bridge is the best bridge https://t.co/ZbLbWoPF1f@leftoutside Always wanted to be able to do that. Is it easy?

B4 that Balham :)@leftoutside Apprenticeship?@leftoutside This is your new job?@mekosoff No need to fear. The invisible hand will soon sort this out.@portraitinflesh Yup Rohm@portraitinflesh What about Rohan pre beer hall putsch.

Even our email training has 'imagine your email ends up on the front page of the local tabloid'@chrisdeerin Bought that record I think the year stone roses/stone roses came out. Listened to both whilst getting big into dance music. Good times@chrisdeerin The whole of catholic education is just brilliant.@MWStory Can confirm. Shoes on lines are common. Nobody has been able to tell me why@sknthla @Sam_Dumitriu U don't think Millenials will have their scandals as they grow into positions of power?@s8mb Did anybody do the athlete or 250k think tank exec director joke?@Birdyword What happens if phrased as after 3 years training at current level you expect to earn 5m a year@Birdyword One obvious prob, 'expected' still has some chance to me of not achieving.
