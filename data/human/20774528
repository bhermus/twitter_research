Shocking customer service!@ATrueman1878 Well whoever it was I hope they send it backVAR, killing football since 2018 #LIVWBA@ady_brown Suarez plays for Barca@ady_brown I would. That's my opinion. As a lover of the game I'd have to accept it.Not sure if I like this VAR. For me controversial and debatable decisions are a part of football.  Jury is out... #LEIFLE@efcmitch No it wasn't that bad of a fail!Just opted for a single cheeseburger instead of my usual double cheeseburger chaser.  For no apparent reason. Tastes wrong.

Sometimes it's obvious a manager needs sacking but most of the time the team are just on a bit of a bad runIf Leicester had of sacked Pearson when bottom of the table, they'd probably have been relegated and definitely wouldn't have won the league
