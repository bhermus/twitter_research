Loved him on Cheers. Farewell, Harry the Hat. https://t.co/6WcwjyeFgaI guess it worked. Daniels drew two times as many viewers as Comey. (Insert joke here.)Anybody else notice the difference in the images used by ABC to promote the James Comey interview and by CBS to promote the Stormy Daniels interview? https://t.co/if4saLCbzgI bet she's not actually thankful for that. I bet she actually wishes those had happened. https://t.co/Z69pioB7pqPromises, promises. https://t.co/JdtYwcva5gI'll be on The Hagmann Report tonight at 9:30 EST to discuss Zuckerberg's House testimony.

https://t.co/oclNvijJshIt's all good. This headline already told me more than I "need to know." https://t.co/swUB4qB0VRIn an election year? Sure he can. https://t.co/DTkxWed1cKJoe and I don’t always agree, but he’s a smart guy (except when he disagrees with me, obviously) and he’s spot on here.

Well-intentioned or not, public school employees are agents of the state. If you want to fight that battle, I’m with you. But don’t send your kids to do it. https://t.co/E8nvoZcaDTMark Zuckerberg was just asked by Congress to answer for the results of a study I wrote for @WestJournalism last month. 

https://t.co/8hWL94KfW9@thehill If he worked for Obama, he'd deserve to have every Fox News personality calling for his head.@whitneycovfefe Jimmy Kimmel and virtually anything else are not a good combination.@slavey @MrNashington @PrisonPlanet @LibertarianBlue @Cernovich @ScottMGreer @lucianwintrich @DennisPrager @dangainor @JoeSeales @facebook I agree regarding regulation. However, any comparison between FB and “a newspaper” in inaccurate in just about every way there is to be inaccurate.@PaineInTheNeck @MrNashington @vdare @LibertarianBlue @Cernovich @PrisonPlanet @ScottMGreer @lucianwintrich @DennisPrager @dangainor @JoeSeales I agree. Regulation is a bad idea. An anti-trust investigation makes much more sense.@benlandis I think we already have.@RajShah45 I'm no huge fan of @amazon or @JeffBezos, but you don't "level the playing field" by imposing new taxes on American companies. You do it by reducing the tax burden on disadvantaged competitors. @realDonaldTrump

https://t.co/VnH1VqO3hlI'll be on The Hagmann Report at 7:30 EST to discuss Facebook censorship and other topics... don't miss it!

https://t.co/H8uS4XsJzc@magpiedaytona Yes, sir. Happy to. I’ll DM you my contact info.Click on the link for registration or more information... but if you want to attend, you'll have to act fast.

https://t.co/xCpRwljYNU https://t.co/oHSMmn4R1n@ScottAdamsSays @MaggieJordanACN @FoxNews Probably option three. It’s very common to pre-write stories like these.@EthanKalkwarf @CalebJHull https://t.co/Cy2E9jnbOM Measured by desktop page views pre- and post-algorithm change. Follow-up in the works now.@BreitbartNews did a nice job covering our recent story on Facebook's algorithm changes. @WestJournalism

https://t.co/o5MGkbA3lq@NigelRathbone1 @SteveForbesCEO @USAkidsFirst We're starting to make it. Stay tuned.You've probably suspected this was true for a while. Here are the numbers that show example what Facebook is doing to conservative publishers.

https://t.co/Cy2E9jnbOM@seanhannity I don't normally promote my own stuff (much), but I think conservatives need to see this.

https://t.co/Cy2E9jnbOMWhy is raw, unfiltered honey more expensive? Isn't the honey company doing less to it? Doesn't it cost less to produce? What am I missing?So, Democrats want Steve Bannon punished for contempt of Congress. What are they going to do with the other 327 million Americans with contempt for Congress?If people with guns make you feel unsafe, get a gun and learn how to use it properly. It’s the best protection available to you. https://t.co/JQLALFTQkLThe reason feelings are not constitutional rights: All you have to do is make an otherwise useless observation like this to start impinging on other people’s lives.

Neither of us has a right to feel safe. But we both have the right to carry a gun so as to improve our safety. https://t.co/JQLALFTQkLOf course there will be. There’s never any shortage of people willing to end their political career for the opportunity to write a book about that time they ended their political career. https://t.co/QxZnDDbzD1@cjgermain09 @LRBitisnot Let’s be realistic. It’s probably too late.It's official. @facebook thinks its users are utter morons. https://t.co/dhaH909AdZ@united And I no longer fly United.My column this week. https://t.co/i7hctSDm4V@NancyPelosi @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Let's be very clear: If Nancy Pelosi says "Let's be very clear," whatever comes next is practically guaranteed to be a willful lie designed to promote her own political career and enhance her personal wealth.@LawrenceBlock The movie is nothing at all like the book, which is my favorite of all time, but it’s still a fun movie if you can find it somewhere.My wife is shocked to be sitting so close to Jeff Bridges... or as I think of him, Matt Scudder of @LawrenceBlock’s “8 Million Ways to Die.” https://t.co/2uPgjxRduV@SenSanders "Don't be fooled by that extra money in your pocket. Trump has employed a band of British orphans to pickpocket you. Just watch."@PardesSeleh Alli, obviously.This, among other things, would seem to bode well for the GOP in November.

Don't miss it!@LibertyHangout I don’t even think welfare should exist, and I think this is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever read.Over a year later, The New York Times remains desperate to pin Hillary’s loss on something... apparently anything... other than a desperately flawed candidate.
