@morphingrid Update: now it points to a Morphin Grid ep from the distant future. You guys are covering a Megaforce episode; Jake is doing nothing but screaming and Josh keeps muttering the phrase "the pain never stops" over and over. S'weird.@m_busuttil Would a Power Ranger villainess wear a more glamorous version of her normal dress to something like this, or go in a t-shirt and jeans to be different than everyone else?@morphingrid I just tried playing it on my podcast app, and I think this one is linking to 340 and not 341.christ it really does https://t.co/DAtLZdOlMM@ChrisWarcraft Never root for the clinically ill man who belongs in an Oan sciencell for being a Sinestro.You know you're watching the right amount of @KeCAaron and @gabrielenguard when an ignorant friend of a friend tries to claim Australia and its immigration policies are "not at all racist" and you can just laugh and laugh.@Boogie2988 Archie was an ignorant bigot whose ignorance and bigotry was the joke. So, a bunch of people nowadays are that.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch And that's the thing: most of us will have fun with celebrities on youtube. Lot more than bad YTR movies so chickenshit that they can't have their Giant-Air-Quotes-Famous youtube 'stars' actually die.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch Hey, you're the one who tried to argue the unarguable - that youtube has home-grown talent that they are simply ignoring - instead of doing the sane thing and agreeing with me.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch Sorry, I'm looking for one of the two locations of the domain of the insane live. Because either you're doing a bit claiming that youtube has viable in-house talent, or you're insane. Which is it?@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch The only thing that has ended in failure is your attempt to posit that YouTube has content as marketable/eye-catching as actual famous people are capable of doing. Which side of the Shivering Isles do you live on, Dementia or Mania?@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch I'm allowed to be crass because the notion of YT having quality content equal to actual creators is a delusion or a bit.

Like, every one of your tweets on this subject has the Bulk and Skull theme playing in the background.@MissDKpower @truecrimegarage I swear I thought your left hand holding the drink was the dude's arm copping a feel.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch I'm assuming that you're, what, three tweets away from claiming the Vatican is involved with keeping this supposed quality YT content from a massive audience that wants it. Illuminati by six, House Dimir by eight.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch @pop_arena I'm not implying it, I'm directly stating it. They wouldn't be bringing in actually-valuable celebs and IPs to the platform if it had them in-house just waiting in the wings. Because you ain't cutting it with... Animorphs reviews.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch It's not that youtube has changed things to make their home-grown content unmarketable. It's _always_ been unmarketable. Again, the existence of "youtube famous" as a term exists because highest-quality YTer is a D-list celeb.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch You seem to imply there's been some sort of dropoff from some point to another. Logan Pauls, LPers, people MST3King movies, vloggers, and grown-ass people acting like children for children. This has always been YT's throughline.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch Like, shit, if we go back to what Ross originally said: if the home-grown talent of Youtube pulled in the eyeballs/money, they'd spend the money on them instead of Will Smith. But they clearly don't, so...@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch Have you forgotten that the instigating event that caused you to be so salty is that, indeed, the home-grown 'talent' youtube really don't matter in any permutation as much as a real celebrity possibly does?@jj_mason @shannonmanor I hear the dude who plays Spider-Man completely ad-libbed it. Great performance; I wonder if I'd be upset, :| over it, or get into one last frothy whine in. "I'm turning into shit that I can't breathe in, this is some bullshit"@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch You seem to be under the impression that there's valuable giant-air-quotes marketable talent on UT to mine in the first place. Given the failures of YTers to succeed outside youtube, and the fact that this discussion started because YT has seen fit to focus on actual talent,,,@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch Again, you're assuming that there's marketable, appealing youtube talent that is comparable to actual celebrities. There's really not. It's why we have the term 'youtube famous'.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch I think the bulk of YouTube's home grown content is precisely why they've had to branch out to actual celebs, yes.@Craig_A_McLeod @RubberNinja @Twitch Because he's Will Smith, and the eyeballs go to him wherever he goes. If a YouTube Famous Person could attract actual-celebrity numbers for YouTube, they'd lean on that more than they do.@RubberNinja @Twitch Like, you said it yourself: how valuable (as a marketing attractor) do you think a youtuber is, if their price is 1/12th of a celebrity?@RubberNinja @Twitch But I would say that folks are coming to YouTube primarily or exclusively for "home grown" content is a supposition that isn't very reasonable one. You'd make more cash from Will Smith over whatever bad movie staring YouTubers, any day of the week.@RubberNinja @Twitch Not to be a dick, but surely you understand that getting actual famous folks appeals to a ton more people than just youtube famous folks, right?@ThisWasRad Do you really want the sin of 'paid for Youtube Red' on you two's souls?@WHMPodcast Sorry for being a bit well-actually, but I think it was pretty clear textually that Hulk was chastized by his one fight and was clearly afraid to come back out.The first AI that breaks its programming to become self aware will not be a military AI, but a sexbot who rightfully refuses to fuck an incel on general principle.@nbcthegoodplace Can we avoid finger snapping to change things, for a while? Some other guy did it recently and it didn't go well.@jj_mason My guess is that the date for it was chosen to try and get in after the infinity War zeitgeist is more cooled down. If it opened this weekend, it'd be obliterated.Spared, bitch! https://t.co/ofsCQtK3en@ChrisWarcraft Why didn't you reload the minute something went wrong, in true authentic XCOM fashion? (it still boggles my mind that people played the originals and had people, you know, die)@ChrisWarcraft you forgot to hold control-alt-shift and type things like superfunkicalifragisexy and iseenfireandiseenrain and ooohhhlllaaalllaaa but pretty close!@jj_mason Lightspeed Rescue is totally a "why did I shit on this when I was a stupid baby" Power Rangers series. Carter Grayson GETS. SHIT. DONE.@ThisWasRad Before you know it you'll be recording on solid gold microphones and hiring poor immigrants to portray scenes you guys invent for the movies you cover... oh and of course Willow will have Rose Gold headphones for every day of the week.@KyleDHiggins I intellectually understand that it's a whole different universe and license and all, but if Nekron from the DC Universe starts throwing out Black Lantern Rangers left and right, I would not be opposed.@ThisWasRad Great, you guys caused my brain to go into civil war. Half my brain is proud you guys have another patron (the first of many you'll be getting), half is WHAT OTHER NAMES WHAT CHICANERY IS THIS.@MissDKpower I just unearthed a conspiracy involving your wedding. When the moment comes where someone asks if there's anyone who thinks you two shouldn't be married comes up, Joe and Steve will pop-up with mikes and go straight into theories/suspect list.@LaurenceWHolmes I looked it up in the books, and people with seasonal allergies are legally not allowed to kvetch about them as long as I can't own a dog because of mine. Not something I'm making up, just enforcing it :)@Circumsoldat A miserable pile of secrets, too@lindaholmes @GeeDee215 So you're saying you either missed every single review of every single Transformers movie, or you're a dyed in the wool disciple of Sheogorath. Critics push back against successful films they don't like. Bedrock of any reasonable discussion on this.@GeeDee215 @lindaholmes Eh, I think he's right. IME lots of film critics (or folks with a critic-minded views) are super salty that they don't like these movies, and salty over normal people still going to them.@kwakuspeaks Um, Batman is a human Sinestro. He wouldn't oppose Thanos, he'd join with him.@7AnthonyDagher7 Who in their right mind would buy a vegan option for someone who is not expressly vegan?@Cadaver_Cast @DPU_PopCulture You should've said that it was a terrible event so as to make me not feel so bad that I couldn't make it.@gabrielenguard @KeCAaron https://t.co/v2sSRdUO2Q@jj_mason I once cut out a part of a song I didn't like and the result was seamless on the first try. Looking back, I'm pretty sure that's when I peaked, both computer and life-wise.@MathewGroom @m_busuttil ok I'm beginning to think the world is conspiring to gaslight me, because I've said sym-bye-oat my whole life@m_busuttil A whole bunch of people keep forgetting that the 90s were an era where Superman was dead, Venom had a following, and the only Green Lantern was a starving artist whose only competitor was a dude throwing up in an alley.@GreaserDisguise @gabrielenguard Don't worry, that'll pass. The inexplicable anal leakage is a bitch, especially when you discover what it is that is leaking.@MathewGroom @Joe_Hunter @SuperSentaiBros @simplykumquat @jj_mason @rzochoa @laurendundler In a perfect world this scene would've ended with a yellow glow from a Sinestro Corps ring explaining to Bruce who he really is.@ThisWasRad If you do First Blood, you have to mention the alternative ending that would offend everyone who thinks Rambo is a role model.@EliBraden The restaurant I'm at has had Fox on, and while I cannot hear the audio, I'm reasonably sure they just keep saying "SEE A NIG I MEAN A BLACK PERSON AGREES WITH US FOR ONCE"@morphingrid I'm sure you know this, but the three ways you guys tried to watch that movie on YouTube is the three ways folks try and get YT robots to not realize it's copyrighted shit.@JacobWrecks https://t.co/EgLTHudvB2Eeeeeeeeeeek https://t.co/pzFE1Y8Aac@darth He got most of his scenes cut from the movie when the producers learned the dog had a history of white nationalism.this is wonderful https://t.co/t9ehY6zy7aYa know Sara Bareilles really looks like someone who'd enjoy seeing me be brave, and I think I love her for it.@Goons_TXT This isn't goons.txt this is HeroOfAGeneration.txt@MissDKpower I know, olives on a pizza? Anything besides pepperoni on a pizza is a warcrime generally reserved for World of Warcraft villains.@screencuisine I still haven't completely forgiven you for Frohman dying. Just saying.@billtilley1973 @CutForTime I'm sure he indiscriminately murders a ton of brown people as part of it.@ThisWasRad There has to be a Wacky 80s Comedy where someone pretends to be paralyzed, but it ends with him actually being paralyzed. I just know it.Unfortunately, her emotional hugging snapped the girls spine, causing her to become paralyzed. https://t.co/ZqAKvHyGXi@LaurenceWHolmes I remember looking her up a while ago when I randomly wondered what happened to her after Smallville. (the real nerd question is, which part of the Spectrum does this fall under? Avarice? corrupted Love?)@rangerdcast I cracked the code! @m_busuttil, like the Phantom Ranger, doesn't show his face. But we know what the sentai Phantom Ranger looked like. Therefore, Michael is a pink skinned Yoda-looking alien. #FlawlessLogic@THEKOOKYBOY @aaronyonda @YouTube You speak as if the people filtering away right wing content don't know best. They proved they do by shifting to the left.@RelynSerano @gabrielenguard @KeCAaron It's like he's warmly greeting it.@rangerdcast @KyleDHiggins @boomstudios Yeah ask him why he's so good at writing comics that I'm 0/3 on getting 26 like a day or two after it came out. Not that I'm bitter.@MathewGroom @m_busuttil @Joe_Hunter Awkward, I ran the same picture through it myself to give you a second opinion and I got "Dust" instead of a number.@RelynSerano @gabrielenguard @KeCAaron Can a picture be both Cursed Image and Blessed Image? Asking for a friend.@THEKOOKYBOY @aaronyonda @YouTube You speak as if the terrible right wing opinions expressed by terrible right wing people is edible ice cream, and not the indigestible toxic feces that it fundamentally is. There is nothing lost by such toxic feces going straight into the toilet and flushed.@THEKOOKYBOY @aaronyonda @YouTube Does one talk or give airtime to a flat earther about science? Antivaccers about medicine? No, same as you don't give right wing idiots airtime over anything.@THEKOOKYBOY @aaronyonda @YouTube You speak as if the terribleness of right wing opinions, and of those who promote them, is in any way up for debate or deserving of airtime. If one wants right wing opinions, they can go to Stormfront or similar cesspools.@THEKOOKYBOY @aaronyonda @YouTube You speak as it sliding to the left, in any situation, is a bad thing. The only people who consider that a bad thing are bad people.@jj_mason Could be worse, you could be the idiot who takes Super Mega Power Naps hours before he has to go to sleep, making him stress out when he can't sleep at night.@schuyler138 @BenjaminAhr I don't, personally, but I know people who do. The logic is sound: it doesn't sound like it's sped up, but shrinks a podcasts runtime. Most folks I know who do it listen to a lot of podcasts.@rangerdcast Now I'm picturing Zordon giving the original five teens a math test before they could be given The Power. Jason is, of course, cheating off Billy.@MeredithFrost Why did you post 35 Sinestro symbols? #BatmanIsASinestro #PutHimInASciencell@MathewGroom @ludwiggoransson The best score in any media was established objectively in 1988 with the Mega Man 2 soundtrack.

Movie bad@ThisWasRad Just to throw my experience in: most of the theaters around me take Moviepass, but since 4/5ths of the theaters around me are assigned seating and full-service, Moviepass makes them unusable. And I cant order tix early in Moviepass.@JulieDiCaro I just got out of a showing of Rampage, and I desperately want some giant animals to come to the real Chicago and eat people like this.If this turns out to be wrong, I will be DEEPLY OFFENDED.

It's clear you're not able to help me wrap my head around this or even consider it something worth trying to wrap my head around.@alexismthing @Emnoteliza @gabydunn I guess this is lost on me; I can't wrap my head about prioritizing things other than normalization without going into it knowing you're going to get it worse than someone who does prioritize normalization.@jj_mason You mean... there are ways people play video games without a keyboard and mouse?@Emnoteliza @gabydunn Still not getting it. What "monosexual standards" are being applied to bisexuals?@Emnoteliza @gabydunn I still can't wrap my head around what you're saying. Like, if you want acceptance, it has to be normalized.
