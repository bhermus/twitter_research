@PierreVLeBrun He played a season in WPG right?Wow the fix is in for this one. Refs are literally handing this one to the Sixers.@splcenter Mmmkay@OKEx_ Zebi@NBABeLike Trying winning it all without him.@coopsie39 @Lowetide If you think Caggiula is an NHL caliber player then I feel for ya.@coopsie39 @Lowetide Fan the way you want. I will do the same.@OilersBlues @Lowetide Wait till Chia has his "Blake Wheeler" moment and trades Jesse P.  For Faulk.@Lowetide If they trade for Faulk I'm done. Literally done.@HackswithHaggs Oiler fans are laughing. Try beating a team 5 times and still losing the series then talk to us about officiating.@jonrmcleod You need new friends ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›@jonrmcleod Oh I'm laughing... But it's not at Sixers potential... Lol@JasonGregor Well.@jonrmcleod Lol... How does that even remotely make one iota of sense. By saying Sixers will be better next year you obviously thought they would roll over Celtics this year. Whatevs bud.@jonrmcleod So next year they would somehow be better when Celtics have 2 All Stars on the bench? Jon... Connect the dots bro.@jonrmcleod Of course you didn't. You just implied they were better.Where you at @jonrmcleod?Bench 3 Sixers 0 #celtics@dstaples It's weird... Its overly bearish from what I read on this player.@dstaples You wouldn't know it reading Oiler forums.@DavidStaplesYEG @dstaples How about we stop the BS identity politics and focus on getting people a better quality of life. This country is sinking economically.@JDEye Note to Oiler fans everywhere. #FireTheCoach@Franktmcveety @SpencerFernando He really is useless isn't he.@Robin_Brownlee @JasonGregor We could just acquire Sam Gagner and throw him on D.@DKingBH @regwald Sounds about right.Can't make it up folks. https://t.co/JrktOgp3lyBench 2 Sixers 0 #CelticsSo no rust, they made shots... What excuses will the pundits make for Sixers tonight? #CelticsJason Tatum should be the first option EVERY TIME. His offensive toolbox is ridiculous. #Celtics@dstaples He got one thing right. #FreeLouieJezzuz this EDM MSM pitching Justin flippin Faulk who couldn't find his own end with a map. #Oilers@KurtLeavins Now tell us how Drake Caggiula is an NHLer.@dstaples He is fast skilled and a good possession player. All the things TMc and Oiler fans think Drake Caggiula is.@SuperNovs1 Wow that is awesome!@MichaelSuppo Missed ZEBI. Damnnit.Bench 1 Sixers 0. #CelticsKyle Brodziak is a 5 on 5 possession black hole. But a lot of smart people say he's the play. If he is a good PKer then prove it cause that will be the argument. #Oilers@JDEye That's no Nic-oh-..........@CJLangdon0574 @auntmimi15 @jimmykimmel @michelleisawolf @jimmy Real funny.@jimmykimmel @michelleisawolf Now tell us SNL is funny too.@Lowetide @TheAthleticEDM Yeah that'll happenButton is more of a meme than Cherry. Stop talking about his rankings. #Oilers #Draisaitl@SpencerFernando Which begs the question....@Archaeologuy @regwald He is a really good smiler.@CondorsHolty Only dwarfed by the snow making machine business.@NHLbyMatty I don't care about any of these teams. The Oilers beat the Ducks 5 times last year. Cry me a river.Sail on Sleps. https://t.co/z0q7ZlAiq6@Mike_StraussJr @zolal_alvi @MichaelSuppo Yeah i must be missing something there. They are all about interoperability.@Alex_Kozora OH SNAP!@Alex_Kozora They said they wanted WRs that can "Contest" balls. JW has that ability in spades.@SuperNovs1 Steal there. Steelers trying to move up.Love the 2 corners for GB @SuperNovs1@TheOilKnight @dstaples This x 10000000.@jules_su And with evidence like that...@TheOilKnight Yeah he seems to maybe be the most complete package of the bunch would you say? I heard Alex Pietrangelo as a comparison.@TheOilKnight Dobson for me... But I know next to nothing about these kids.@HilljrKelley @RodriquezKhaliq @johnlegend Just Wow.@johnlegend Don't give examples or anything.@jonrmcleod *checks out season series*@kanyewest Man I am loving this!@dstaples @bpry8 Meh, Bruins screwed us on the Hamilton deal. Leafs have done nothing in my lifetime. Easy decision for me.@Lowetide Jarome Iginla@Sonnyjames22 @_kirstenalyssa @NHLBruins +1@StuThePenguin @crypto_rand If you are crapping on crypto don't bother.@crypto_rand Sales are good folks. Make note of the winners and buy em on sale.@jonrmcleod Also. Defense. Celtics defend better than any team in the league when healthy.@jonrmcleod Celtics are deeper because they have budding superstars in Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown. They are lottery picks. You can't just "get" that kind of depth. Celts are loaded.@jonrmcleod There's the other advantage. Our GM and HC smoke the Sixers.@jonrmcleod Kyrie is a superstar. Hate to break it to you.@jonrmcleod I will bet you right now Celtics finish ahead of Sixers next year. They were best team before Kyrie injury and with a superstar on the sidelines.@jonrmcleod OMG Jon you are impossible. Stay in the Now would ya? Lol.@jonrmcleod If you want to pretend the Sixers are deeper than Celtics then go ahead. You are dreaming.@jonrmcleod Dude. The Celtics were best team in the Eastern Conf all year. I am not sure what you were watching. I hope you get Lebron. It will ruin Sixers and more specifically... Simmons.@jonrmcleod 2 players? Pfft. We got the whole lineup Son.@Archaeologuy @OilersBlues He will be back. Why? No idea.@Bob_Stauffer Does he line match? Work the refs? Throw his team under the bus?@Alex_Thomas14 Yet Drake Caggiula remains.Yup. https://t.co/2sGRmXHwbm@WheatNOil @bpry8 While MSM can throw up softballs to a Head Coach who plays Milan Lucic on  the first line and PP1 despite not scoring a goal in a zillion games. Hypocrites.@NHLbyMatty While you guys give the head coaches a free pass and never ask the tough questions. 2 way street.@jonrmcleod By all means. But Celtics are gonna own the East next year.@jonrmcleod Yes with no Kyrie. No chance with Kyrie.@jonrmcleod They are good but come on. Our 1 thru 5 kills yours. Celtics were first in Eastern Conf. Without Hayward and a gimpy Kyrie.@jonrmcleod Don't think so. We have Tatum Brown and 2 superstars on the sidelines.The future is bright #BostonCeltics@dstaples What? A promotion?So Taylor Hall is out... Maybe the Nerds can tell us what to tweet about next.@IAmByks What we gunna talk about now?Stud. https://t.co/rqNGZMTzNNHow much booze is enough to handle a group of delirious Winnipeg Jets at a 10 hr Poker game? #Oilers #Jets@NSBruinFan Well I like Keith Gretzky's draft last year so we'll see what happens.@JDEye @Bob_Stauffer "starting NOW!"
--Kozmo Kramer@NSBruinFan Man I never disliked a coach more.@NSBruinFan Hey Cory! Get ready for some Oiler talk and some really offensive political tweets! I think Big D unfollowed me!  ;)@loc8ingoil Is it 2019 yet?@AIisonTayIor @AdamSchefter Plantation? Might wanna check out some "decades long" Democrat run cities honey.@OilersBlues @AzorcanGlobal @SportsExtra1260 @Lowetide @nhlupdate @kluedeke29 I know. I really am dreading another year of TMc and Drake Caggiula.@OilersBlues @Bob_Stauffer Brutal. We'll see what Chia is really made of this offseason. Better find a way to get rid Russ/Sek.@OilersBlues @Bob_Stauffer zactly.@coopsie39 @Bob_Stauffer I never felt easy about the whole "Don't waste McDavid's ELC years". A lot of bad decisions were made trying to build a SC contender over night. If all the Oilers did were draft and develop we'd be in a better spot today. Still think the Reinhart trade was the killer.@Bob_Stauffer DO NOT TRADE THE PICK!Unbelievable...The Red Sox now have 5 Grand Slams on the season after having none last year. #RedSoxNation@crypto_rand So buy ICX is what yer sayin?@Lowetide sure hope so@AzorcanGlobal @SportsExtra1260 @Lowetide @nhlupdate @kluedeke29 I don't care. Just fire the entire coaching staff. TMc makes me long for Eakins.@Buster_ESPN Holy SSS batman.And the blind spot gets bigger with this player. I swear it's a disease that Oiler fans/bloggers/media have and have had forever...the love of AHL players. https://t.co/Jl4Pazv5KQ #AimHigher@dstaples @kurt Trent Yawney. Book it.@RealCandaceO @DonCheadle They can't debate. They are allergic to facts.@Woodguy55 For the record... I am a Dual Citizen... Just in case you wondering but I'm sure you weren't. ðŸ™‚Just wonderful https://t.co/ykxq1lCPMS@bpry8 Maybe but he couldn't hurt.@bpry8 ANA has been top 5 in PK last 3 years under Yawney@bpry8 Same responsibilities in ANA as well.@bpry8 He worked primarily with D and PK in SJ.@bpry8 Not sure... Just know he was an Assistant under TMc before he left to pursue Head Coaching opportunities in the A.So I'm calling Yawney to EDM based on Stauffers comment about Ducks potential coaching changes affecting the Oilers. #Oilers #yawn*looks at Avalanche D*  #Oilers@frank_seravalli right call imo...I honestly thought he wouldn't get anything based on clean past. Too egregious to let go.@crypto_rand Are all your calls posted here? Do you have another medium or group? Cheers.That's too bad. https://t.co/fqHGhZd7iK@Sean_McAdam Jonny Gomes sounds like he's been doin Color for 20 years. Awesome Job! #RedSox@DirtbagDonny @bpry8 So yer tellin me there's a chance? YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!@golfnuttt I will bet you a nickel he doesn't get anything.@golfnuttt Brutal. Massive fail by the refs there.Holy Crap how do refs miss a crosscheck to the neck? #Jets #WildTackling isn't a penalty in the playoffs didn't you know? #Jets@Archaeologuy Can we trade TMc and the 1st for him?@Lowetide @coopsie39 @TheAthleticEDM I think Ryan scores at a higher rate than a 4C...is that how he was used in CAR?@regwald "Pfftt... We have continuity!"See? This isn't difficult EDM. https://t.co/2qtWnleRCn@dstaples @NugeTeddy X 10000000@dstaples Nope. Me neither.@OilersNow See how fast that was TMc?@crypto_rand @TE_FOOD Criminally undervalued. If this isn't a huge winner I will find another hobby.@coopsie39 I know the reality but I will protest it. Ergo... I haven't accepted shit.@coopsie39 I am already disappointed. This all started with you suggesting I should accept it. I will not.Shocker. https://t.co/iYzZFgDYxC@coopsie39 Either way... It doesn't look good for EDM. He is not an NHLer@coopsie39 Not what I understood. If you have something that says otherwise please share it. If you do that only shows TMc is more clueless than originally thought.@coopsie39 It would be different if he was still signed to the same idiotic guaranteed ice time contract he is coming off of. There is no need to sign this player.@coopsie39 I won't accept it. By every metric he is terrible. If he and TMc are back I will have even more time to devout to BAK coverage.Why are Oiler fans penciling in Drake Caggiula next year? This experiment failed. He is not an NHLer. Aim higher. #Oilers@Richie_Kotzen Come to Winnipeg please!@NHLbyMatty The latter 2 being late round picks. Incredible.Close yer eyes and imagine Matt Barzal and Kyle Connor on the Bruins. Say what you want about Chia but that is scary. #Bruins #OilersKadri is a damn fine player. He was traded 100 different times when the Leafs were struggling a few years ago. Proof that some of the best moves are the ones you don't make. Big loss for Leafs. #Leafs #Oilers #TellChia@anthonyfurey That's one way of putting it.@usacsmret @DineshDSouza Yeah the bottom line has a tendency to do that.@Lowetide Caleb looks real good. Can't wait to see him up with the big club.@anthonyfurey Bombing Syria was wrong in everyway. We'll agree to disagree. The Neocons have his ear and that's dangerous.@anthonyfurey https://t.co/89go7528Fe@anthonyfurey I agree with a lot of what he has done but bombing nations to show strength is not what his base elected him for. He tweeted against such actions only 5 years ago.Atta Boy Nolan! #Flyers@KimDotcom @Ian56789 Jezzuz H what a moron.My Gord how did Koivu survive that? #Buff@SuperNovs1 @coopsie39 @bpry8 And another year of Samorukov. I was very impressed with him.@SuperNovs1 @coopsie39 @bpry8 Curious to see Hebig.@coopsie39 If Condors play the kids next year I am going all in on my coverage of them. I tweeted lots in the past but not much to cover this year as far as prospects go.@Ian56789 @SkyNews Wow.@Ian56789 Need more "why" and less "look at those warmongers!" What is the end game of this nonsense?Can we get Sather in here again to trade Gretz, Lowe, MacT, and Coffey for Futures? #Oilers #OBC@SuperNovs1 I just want a coach that can run a decent system, can line match, and doesn't throw his players under the bus. Average special teams would nice as well.@SuperNovs1 Tomlin called him a one trick pony. His hands were average at best. He had all world speed and that's about it. Not a great route runner either.Cooper Maroody arguably has better numbers than newly named AHL ROY Mason Appleton. You still have to do the work but I like this bet by Chia. Another factor is development... Something the Oilers organization can learn a thing or 2 from Jets.@SuperNovs1 I remember when Mike Wallace was in PIT and angling for big new contract. I said back then AB was the better receiver. Thank Gawd Steelers got it right and gave $ to AB instead.Is this a joke? https://t.co/ttFcDhP8BU@SmartTipps Great list@Woodguy55 Now can the OBC just get lost?@SuperNovs1 I want TMc gone more. I don't think I can watch him behind the bench next year.Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz@SuperNovs1 #stillEvaluating@Lowetide We're so doomed with TMc.@EDProspectWatch Definitely going to purchase AHL package if the roster is full of prospects next year. Thx for update!
