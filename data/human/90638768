@Rick_City Because it's fun!@ASaunders_PGH Clearly heads need to roll if they don't win every cup from now until 87 and 71 retire. #hottakeexpressCan't win forever, and the Caps are a good team, but the goals the pens give up sometimes are mind boggling.  Caps are still the caps so Pens still have a shot.@dupweeeee Oh I read it more generally lol.@dupweeeee Vegas! MAF!@HockeyMeesh Ahhh I got beat to it lol.@amc424 #analysis heh@MattGajtka Minus goaltending.My kid has reached the age where he is a total tattle tell about things I'm trying not to tell my mom (aka bicycling purchases) haha.@Dejan_Kovacevic I use YoutubeTV. ~$35 a month, 95% coverage of all sports (CBS and NBCSports are key channels for me for obvious reasons) I want to watch.  I add in HBO NOW occasioannly if I want to watch a series and I cancel it when I'm nit using it.@TheSlowRidePod Important question: Are Plus bikes, fat bikes or mountain bikes?   Do you lose partial cred or is this a digital type issue.@seangentille Why is intent even part of the equation?  If you shoulder blast someones head it should be a penalty or suspension.  That's really the only system that will actually get guys to not raise their shoulder when going into a hit.  NFL has at least mostly figured this out.@danpfeiffer And people thought there wouldn't be any more opportunities to point out how morally bankrupt he is after that retirement announcement.@Jalopnik @BioshockLGP I cannot for the life of me understand why people love SUVs. Most small ones don't even have decent cargo space and they are unpleasant to drive.  I understand the truck machismo. I dont understand the I'd rather have a tall brick with meh cargo space over a car AND pay 5k more.@ForecasterEnten Can't it just be both?  More people were tired of Dems and were going to vote R no matter what AND The specifics of the race (comey, negative press of Clinton etc) cut into her share of independent or non party loyal voters?  How do you say which one is why she lost?Raise your hand if you're surprised that Hannity is secretly getting government subsidies and railing on others getting govt benefits on a nightly basis.. *crickets* Yup, that's what I thought.CARL WITH THE GOOD HAIR.Currently avoiding homework by binge watching @EverydayDriver season 1 on Prime... Super great show!Hahaha Sid makes a great pass for a Geno goal as he gets booed is delicious.Super happy for Fleury.  Love to see this. https://t.co/26IY8yBbtC@MikeDarnay How much do they not trust Holtby that this ~0.82 sv% through 1 &amp; 2/3 games is worth sticking by? Seems crazy.@David_Shorr I agree. He is a complicated figure.  That doesn't make his discussion about Trump's behavior meaningless though.@whygavs Just make new email addresses and continually get free months@jonfavs Silly liberals with your reality.  It's the sentiment that counts!@AGretz I'd vote Camden Yards.  Citi...its nice, but it's kinda all by it's lonesome on long island.  Tho I did see Clint Barmes hit a home run there somehow....Citizens Bank is just generic Broad Street Stadium.  Never been to Nats tho.@edsbs @darth Wool jacket and sports t-shirt.... #DadStyle. LoL https://t.co/YNySaUq3nj@AndrewCrow @darth @Strava KOMThat was disgusting.@pghsciencenerd I do the same but with the "SWEAR TO ME" hahaha@ProFormFitness Thanks for the great support, new parts arrived and treadmill is back from the dead!@julia_azari I think this at least once a day about very nearly every bit of news out of the WH lol https://t.co/eHH4oJHXrR@ajacarin  https://t.co/15eS40ymjt@ajacarin Get back to your assigned space Oftony, those dirty pics are ruining our society.@FiveThirtyEight 11 billion dollars is nothing and could be easily funded.  The tax bill borrowed 1.5 trillion for a tax cut.  I appreciate the analysis in the article itself, but the headline is bad.USA ties it with 30 some seconds to go! #ParalympicsAnd companies wonder why illegal streams are eating into their profits.  Even paying customers can't watch games they should be able to.So the Pens game is blacked out on @NHLTVSupport because it is on Nat'l TV, and it's also blacked out on my @YouTubeTV because I live in the Philly market... So even though I'm out of market and pay for 2 forms of media I'm blacked out. Awesome.@BioshockLGP Sadly The ergos of an accord just do not work for me i have no idea what it is but I'm never comfortable in them.  I'm just gonna hope for low 2ndary market of Chevy SS when it comes time to get a Dad sedan so I can have a stick in one haha.@BioshockLGP Wish it had a 6 speed.  Says auto only.  It was one of the only sedans left with one.This is great. But it needs audio! Haha - How to Turn Google Maps Into Mario Kart

Can you imagine the insanity?  They would be calling for a coup.@erinscafe Grifters gonna grift. I'm not even surprised anymore that's how bad it is.Messed up shoulder but #Razer is helping me pay League still.  Life and Lemons n'at. https://t.co/jODrSscnowSuper bummed out.  Was so exciting about cycling season starting and I just trashed my shoulder and am going to be in a sling for weeks.There's no escape from what haunts me.  Even marvel movie escapism has too many things to trigger the memories.  How do you let go of a person that no longer exists but who lives inside you and won't go away?@whygavs I totally geeked out over that artixle today sitting in front of my SEM haha@micahcohen @538politics Suicide vs murder. Gotta go murder, unfortunately.@AGretz @katiebhockey @jmarshfof I'm from Beaver County.... Hot Dog Shoppe is a craving you can never shake.  So good.Yasssss Pens.@NHLTVSupport Why is every game blacked out on my Roku and Xbox app?  Works fine on my iPad.  These are not in market gamea either.When you know your position is insane and you're in front of 7k ppl you just temporarily change your position! #easymode https://t.co/87RDSHKwKm@HockeywthHannah Riveters or gtfo haha@MattGajtka I had the same problem and then i turned on the TV and didnt have it there either.  If the NHL network is the only place that has it why cant NHLtv have it. Lunacy.@rustbeltkitsch You continue to to state that I should have known 'unspoken' information about a tweet and that mu failure to do so is an insult which nothing but preposterous.@rustbeltkitsch I'm sensitive to how you took the comment. I'm not sensitive to the fact that your meaning was 'painfully obvious' and as such you should immediately berate me. But I doubt very much either of us is changing each others minds about it. It's not worth arguing about further.@rustbeltkitsch Unstated things are not often obvious especially when the language you use contradicts the thing you say is supposed to be obvious. I've apologized that my tone wasn't as I intended it to be, no need to keep harping on it.@rustbeltkitsch I didn't assume anything. The only person who assumed anything was you. I merely responded to a post that I thought kids were mostly just parroting because it was a topic of interest to me and I wanted to start a convo about it.  If it didn't come across that way, my apologies.@rustbeltkitsch I wasn't trying to explain anything but ok I guess. Am I not allowed to disagree with the premise that 6 year olds have any clue what they are talking about when it comes to politics without it being a personal attack on you or an attempt to put you down?  Because it was neither.@rustbeltkitsch Their parents have strong convictions on Trump and Obama. Kids seem to pick up on all that stuff. But it's mostly parroting.  Just watch the obligatory CPAC sub 10 yr old getting a fox news interview that happens every year.New furnace was being installed and the former home owner had a hidden stash behind the air handler üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/jIcV8c3Oyp@NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight Technically correct Nate is the best Nate.Fart noise. https://t.co/2ocENp69stLove it.  https://t.co/UPho9PWPRI@TheAthleticPGH @RobBiertempfel Why not just force him to unblock everyone since the ratio of his blocks from actual harassment is absurdly low rather than put the impetus on your paying customers?@zoeclaire_ Preparing the NyQuil atm.@ajacarin Awesome. Congrats!@ajacarin Getting a nursing gig?Trump‚Äôs Saturday Night Massacre is already happening, writes  @GrahamDavidA https://t.co/rMujqIOFGy@DKPghSports @Dejan_Kovacevic @dlolley_pgh But yes, they probably have passed both the 70s Steelers and the 80s Niners in terms of maximizing success in one era with the same starting QB.@DKPghSports @Dejan_Kovacevic @dlolley_pgh They already have been a better dynasty for the past 15 years. The franchise doesn't have the kind of long term success that the Steelers do though. Need to have periods of sustained success beyond one coach/qb combo to really become a franchise like Pitt/SF/Dallas.The joke is on us. The memo was a nothing burger but the 2 weeks of intense campaigning to release it and saying it was a bombshell was more damaging than the actual info.  It was 'winning' while pushing a story that facts won't be able to fix. Thats the media game Dems fail at.@NHLGIFs My hero üòç haha@MattGajtka @PghHockeyDigest @petershockey @CCVikingsHockey @PIHLhockey @STAAtalent @PetersPuck @GataTheCreator Noooo its so good. Just let yourself dabble.  It's heaven to write with. Get an everyday one like https://t.co/9ua8gETWDY@MattGajtka @PghHockeyDigest @petershockey @CCVikingsHockey @PIHLhockey @STAAtalent @PetersPuck @GataTheCreator They're good. Not fountain pen good, but for a disposable they're about as good as it gets.@BioshockLGP Hm. I assume most people are lazy like me hahah. Either way, it's hard to go with 1 unsubstantiated claim.  Not really defending it in general, but If i have to rely on anonymous unsubstantiated claims I would need to see more than 1 to get on board.@BioshockLGP I try to take people as reasonably honest, but I have emails and texts on my phone saved for an eon of time and with all the auto backups etc. the chances that something that inflammatory was seen but not saved by three different people is.....small.@erinscafe Didn't you sign up to be a poll supervisor for Trump or something? You got put on alllll the distribution lists.@erinscafe Never. I too switched to seltzer which helps the diet soda fix, but never found anything to replace coffee.This is incredible.... https://t.co/DB03xADfYi
