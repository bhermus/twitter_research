Lol@UberFacts Well fuckWow heard there are @HarryPotterFilm secret menu items at @Starbucks ... might have to try it and see lolin other news, crazy is a 4 letter word...fighting is my hobby.. try mewhen someone does not understand the WHOLE story... but need that $80 tho lol@DarthWatts @RayRosas Grow it out ... don’t be a bitch#makeamericaobamaagainT shirt sales are one thing but heroes to grow a new fan base... where are they? IMOAnd I like @JoeyRyanOnline just fine, his style doesn't bother me... just saying as a business as a whole, I do not agree things are greatSo the whole argument between @JoeyRyanOnline and @Jimcornette is kind of a wash.. both sides are not pulling a good enough argumentI just feel there are no heroes for kids anymore to rally behind ... honestly everyone is a just either mocking or inside jokingBut eventually those adults get bored, die off etc. no kids watching current product .. no futureYes a kid will go with dad to a show locally or to a wwe show but honestly I feel more adults watch than kids which is fine for nowThis whole wrestling is doing well thing is a lie. Wrestling is not doing well right now... from what I see kids do not watch anymoreShe's pretty extraordinaryDon't know how much longer I can manage ...Not doing good today...Take it easy on my heart...@RealRosenberg @insanewl This bitch lolWho would give a fuck anywayI should just do itI don't think I've ever been so misunderstood as I have been in the past year...Over dramatic AF@insanewl is my #home #iwl #youtube https://t.co/WqZ4MM3PnrI voted for #Arya4MVP!

This weekend will be a blast!When u try to be nice and they just don't wanna be nice back ... #itried@Meshelly_13 Enjoying the show?I just want to sleep... bye for nowI could go on and on of how I am to people but the bottom line is I must deserve this anguish inside of me and deserve the lonelinessDesperately that I wish I could. I wish I hadn't been such a bad person as well... I wasn't always such a good person to people...I don't want it to by any means but I also don't want to keep fighting it. That inner child wants to hide and let go of the pain so...Potential good things for myself over and over again. This demon keeps breathing inside my heart and all I can think is how I let it live ..That the Loneliness is a burning feeling in your heart and u can't always ignore it. 3 years I let this pain eat at me and take away ...U know when I was younger, I used to think people who contimplated suicide were cowards but then I see that pain causes it as I get olderBeing a dad is not something I HAVE to do.. it's something I WANT to do.
