@ClayTravis Wayne Gretzky vs Mario Lemieux in the NHL.Remember when everyone said @KingJames and the Cavs were done?   Damn they on fire tonight ready to go up 2-0 on the road against the choke artist @Raptors . #CavsVSRaptors@ClayTravis I‚Äôll take those SEC studs in DC!  #HTTR@thekidet You should watch SLAPSHOT from the late 70‚Äôs.Hey @the_ironsheik , do you hate The @ovi8 and the @Capitals too?  How do we make them humble? #CBJWell it was a good season.  #CBJI just entered to win tickets to see the @BlueJacketsNHL take on the @Capitals in Game 6 at Nationwide Arena. #CBJ | #MarchOn https://t.co/fFaLPF9jHsSeriously @NHL , are these officials or do they just work at foot locker?  #CBJ #ALLCaps coach @coopblue17 quotes.Plenty of Road Ice Advantage going on in the Metropolitan Division this playoffs season.  #CBJ #AllCaps #Flyers #Pens@DOMTIBERI @BlueJacketsNHL I saw a coyote in my back yard tonight.#CBJ Need to play the period of their lives in 3rd.  Not sure what the first 40 mins were about.Tough loss for the #CBJ at home in double OT on a bad bounce.  Oh well, back at it Thursday.    Still up 2-1! Crowd was insane tonight. #BecauseItsTheCup #CAPSvsCBJ@BlueJacketsNHL record in playoff games decided in regulation 1-11.  Record in playoff OT, 4-1.  #numbersfordummies #CBJ #CAPSvsCBJI feel sorry for all @BlueJacketsNHL fans  in @NationwideArena .  Beer sales stopped over an hour ago.  #CBJ #CAPSvsCBJ #BecauseItsTheCup@Capitals playing an aggressive box on the PK.  Will the @BlueJacketsNHL do the same?  If you want to win the cup, better get aggressive on special teams.  A passive box on the PK, is a one way ticket to Muirfield Village Golf Club for the summer. #CBJ¬† #CAPSvsCBJ@prettygoodhuman @KirkHerbstreit @BlueJacketsNHL @Capitals Next question will be, ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you a Vanderbilt fan?‚Äù@KirkHerbstreit @BlueJacketsNHL Are you headed to NWA for either game?@DOMTIBERI @spinnershells @OSUCoachMeyer So that means Shelly has to spend 13 more winters in Ohio until this kid gets there.   Not sure even Big Sandy could convince her to stay that long.@IanJamesPoulter BabaBooey!@JordanStrack Another reason to shorten the season.@BHOOLZ did I miss your Pro-BOB tweet from Game 1 or 2?  #CBJSomething tells me the Arena District will be selling lots of beer this week!  #CBJDear @NHLBlackhawks , we the fans of @BlueJacketsNHL &amp; the entire city of Columbus thank you for @9Artemi .  May God bless you and your city as you watch these exciting Stanley Cup Playoffs!  #becauseitsthecup #CBJ #Rbar@BHOOLZ Time to give some credit to the guy in the cage tonight Bruce.#CBJ  #CBJ #CBJ #CBJThe best hockey bar in Ohio! https://t.co/0Rq5mvN7kf@LoriSchmidt Time for the Jackets to lose tomorrow and finish in 8th to play the Atlantic Division and avoid the Pens.@MattBaxendell As a CBJ fan, I want to drop to 8th and play in Atlantic.  Much better path, Caps and Pens are still the teams to beat I believe.  Let them fight it out and CBJ take on the winner in conference finals!@BHOOLZ I say let‚Äôs drop to the 8th spot and play in the Atlantic Division for rounds 1 and 2.  Much better path I believe than playing the Caps and Pens.  Let the two of them duke it out.  CBJ needs to avoid Pittsburgh as long as possible.  They are in Stanley Cup form.Free Hockey in Columbus.  Let‚Äôs get that 2nd point and control home ice @BlueJacketsNHL !  #CBJI can remember when @ESPNRadio was all I listened 2 mornings until afternoon,1st it was @Espngreeny &amp; @espngolic then @ColinCowherd then @LeBatardShow ,today‚Äôs line up is atrocious.

It‚Äôs a little Stormy here.  Same? @woodbob66@DOMTIBERI Just don‚Äôt answer the phone.  That‚Äôs what I do.@ClayTravis Just cancelled my subscription because the carrier had a hard time figuring out how to properly bag the paper when it rains.  Soaked paper 50% of the time.Hey @LeahRemini , did you hack The @ScientologyTV Network?  They are saying that they are #toolsforlife !

I gotta root for Michigan to win &amp; Kansas  to make final to win MonkeyPA $$.@ClayTravis Columbus and Nashville came into the league together.  When both teams were playing in the West, it was a great regional rivalry.  Nashville had the upper hand in the series.  I miss those intra-division contests.   Very intense.@LoriSchmidt @1057TheZone Awesome news Lori.  Congrats!@jeremymmatheny @Bcarp3 @kroger Wait a second @Bcarp3 , you stole this from @chris_spielman .  He ranted about this year‚Äôs ago on Spielman on Sports.  I bet your next topic will be dudes that run without a shirt on?Hey @FredDugan , why is POTUS congratulating a dictator on winning a fake election?  You should change your Avatar to a hammer and sickle unless you condemn this.  @woodbob66@spinnershells @mariawsyx6 I hope spin class isn‚Äôt cancelled on WED!Hell of a year @ChrisHoltmann and the @OhioStateHoops  team.  Future is bright in Columbus.  Glad to see Buckeyes Basketball relevant again!  #GoBucks@FakeUrban Do you like Reeses Puffs as much as @spinnershells ?  #AskUrbs@pixarcoco When is this movie going to be available on @DIRECTV  On Demand?@SideEyeSassShow You should read the UMBC Twitter Acct from last night. Gained 60K followers in about 2 HRs.

Better yet, you wearing them!@CherylHines I love this.@ddlovato Thank you!@ClayTravis I will move to Nashville and vote for your Senate Campaign, if this becomes one of your key platforms.   #abolishdaylightsavingtime #TravisforSenateSad to see that @MaryTaylorOH is playing these cards.  She definitely isn‚Äôt in the corner of victims of rape that want to get an abortion.  Also thinks status quo is sufficient in protecting our school children.  As @realDonaldTrump would say, #sad https://t.co/Zrwmcv8WFc@JordanStrack Why did they move the semifinals to Friday?  Anyone there this morning?  Sat/Sun was better.After my first ever spin class today with @spinnershells , I feel like a rejuvenated person.  What a work out!  Well I think it‚Äôs time for some Apple Jacks to celebrate the accomplishment.  They are better than Raisin Bran! https://t.co/LJWJVxpgAr@CherylHines Lake Tahoe@DesmondHoward Broadcast it on Periscope@marcorubio Good, let‚Äôs ban all those 2000+ guns then until ‚Äúwe figure out what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù  Status quo doesn‚Äôt fly anymore.@MikeDeWine @MaryTaylorOH @JohnKasich @realDonaldTrump 4 Central Ohio School districts on lockdown or closed today due to threats or confirmed students with guns.  I will vote for the candidates who don‚Äôt spew talking points and actually solve these problems no matter their partyIt would be so sad if Duke, UNC, Kentucky, and MSU all get in trouble! https://t.co/gdcTyrdyqaDamn those women can ‚ÄúDO THAT HOCKEY!‚Äù  Nice job ladies! #USAHOCKEY #Peongchang2018@MaryTaylorOH Does being ‚Äúpro life without exception‚Äù mean you believe a woman who is raped will go to jail if she has an abortion? https://t.co/u5YdgtWl3FHey @FredDugan , were you at her rally?   @woodbob66 https://t.co/Z27nfJ0Y3Q@SarahKSilverman God Help us.@Bcarp3 I‚Äôll take a cop in all schools.  We have one at Hilliard Davidson.  He helped apprehend the kid that was planning on shooting up the high school 2 years ago.Why can‚Äôt we get back to the days when we had a Democrat President in @BillClinton and a Republican Congress with @newtgingrich and @JohnKasich that worked together, balanced budgets, and eliminated deficits and debt?@anthonygonzalez So I‚Äôm late to the party, didn‚Äôt know you were running for Congress.  I‚Äôm interested to hear your stance on AR-15‚Äôs.  Should they or any other similar type of weapon be legal or illegal?@BillOReilly ‚ÄúCAUTION‚Äù you are about to enter the ‚Äújump the shark‚Äù zone.Is @JohnKasich the last sane voice of a #GOP turning into an insane Alt Right? https://t.co/vtSfpEIBfX@realDonaldTrump while U take your 3am dump, read what Antonin Scalia thinks about guns.  "like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited." It is "not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.‚Äù@JulieFoudy @lindseyvonn The Trump #MAGA supporters were actually cheering for the Russians.  Go get them in the downhill Lindsey!  #peongchang2018 #OlympicWinterGames@SarahKSilverman Usually the pharmacy has discount cards at the register.  So a $300 monthly Med might cost $40 instead.  Just tell them the Cobra payment hasn‚Äôt gone through yet.@BillOReilly As a man of faith, how are you ok with this narrative?  More needs to be done to protect our schools.  This ‚Äúwe live in a free society‚Äù narrative is as old as your program.  Time to ban AR-15‚Äôs and all high powered weapons like we did in the 90‚Äôs.@CherylHines I don‚Äôt think he reads.@chicagofish when did you sign with The Coyotes? https://t.co/tPSk9uEh6U@TomiLahren What is The Republican Party going to do about lunatics then?Hey @Snapchat were any of ya‚Äôll alive when @CocaCola made new coke?

I‚Äôve never seen that before.  There are always CBJ tickets at home available on the exchange.  Vegas season ticket holders must not sell their tickets out there as much.@ddlovato Camp Rock tunes.
