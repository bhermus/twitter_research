https://t.co/9tts33TxZ5@alyharmatz SO GOOD!!!It is not for you to judge the journey of another's soul. It is for you to decide who you are, not who another has been or has failed to be💭• Surrender to what is. Let go of what was. Have faith in what will be. 😌@alyharmatz Oldie but a goodie@alyharmatz My fav movie!https://t.co/H4Uk0JDXDY https://t.co/Xvhf7P6eo5I just published “Social Media Leading The Way For Millennials” https://t.co/h4PvBOLj2KFinally completed my personal website for my online portfolio!

Tryna build my team so let peeps knowAny recent graduates or people looking for a super rewarding job (full-time), DM me!!Something hard is always something worth doing, because that something hard will one day be the best thing you ever did • 💕Maybe the journey isn’t so much about becoming anything. Maybe it’s about unbecoming everything that isn’t really you, so you can be who you were meant to be in the first place. 💭Monday I start my first big girl job and it’s just hit me that I’m no longer in College 😳Someday you’ll look back and understand why it all happened the way it did 🌟“In the day when I cried out. You answered me, and made me bold with strength in my soul.”@Jamie_Fries @alyinas Hahahaha woke up expecting to have perfect skin... was left very disappointed• Be happy, not because everything is good. But because you can see the good in everything 🌻A very Merry Christmas to everyone! 🤩🎄Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire 🔥😊“Forgiveness is not a feeling; it is a commitment. It is a choice to show mercy, not to hold the offence up against the offender. Forgiveness is an expression of love.” - Gary Chapman• You can’t just give up on someone because the situation is not ideal. Great relationships aren’t great because they have no problems. They are great because both people care enough about the other person to find a way to make it work •MY BEST FRIEND JUST GOT ENGAGED!!!!  @aCm_KYI graduate tomorrow.... 😳Most relatable show thats ever existedI don’t know if I could live if 'friends' wasnt on Netflix@MilesWilburn1 It's rough out hereJust guessing where the road lines are right now 🤷‍♀️🤔💭 https://t.co/j5z20AOrihIrving is a much better all round player at the Celtics than he ever was at the Cavs 🍀🍀🍀Last ever undergraduate class 😳Will pay someone to finish this semester for me"You usually have to wait for that which is worth waiting for"@MilesWilburn1 He was overshadowed and never given the opportunity to be the star at the cavs@MilesWilburn1 Who's the most clutch player in the NBA right now?In need of clutch Kyrie to make an appearance these last 8 minutes 🙄🍀I need a Irving Celtics jersey because he may be the best thing for us since Larry Bird 🤷‍♀️🍀I am so lucky my Mummy is also my best friend 💕I wish I could just switch my brain off sometimesIt's CHAMPIONSHIP time!
