MMA hasn't been set back like this since Strikeforce in Nashville.Dr. Prescott was the only rider to actually make it to Concord. As Dawts and Revere were both detained on the road from Lexington to Concord.Things you may not know. 
Revere was not the only rider dispatched with this message. Dr. Samuel Prescott &amp; William Dawts were also sent. All 3 on different routes to increase the chance the message getting through due to British patrols.243 years ago today, April 18th. Paul Revere started his famous ride to Lexington to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that the British were coming to inspect the town of Concord for militia weapons.Im gonna chalk this up to a parody article.
