Thy don’t deserve to move on.@J_Luce Easiest division in the league. He gets home field advantage every year. Just saying.@J_Luce Tom Brady plays in the AFC least, has the easiest road to the Super Bowl, didn’t complete a perfect season when given the chance, lost to the Giants twice, and still kisses his dad on the lips.When you have Michigan and Loyola and win on two buzzer beaters. Was a good day.@kirstinfarley Good job Kirs💰@SeanDennis20 Bunch of bums, so much talent, so little success. Arizona is the biggest disappointment in NCAA tourney history, change my mind.Arizona please go home, you’re a bunch of bums.Anybody else have Loyola Chicago?8-3. 8 goals allowed.

I feel for the victims and call for them to clean house.Lee on Wednesday, who’s down?@Arsenal thank you@J_Luce Don’t blame her@maximilian19d @TimKennedyMMA I totally agree, at the time he wasn’t respected as a human being first and it would be a huge ask to die for someone who hates you. In today’s world Tim’s statement is more valid.@KPJR13 Offset been the best since no labelKuz control to the maxListening to Knights games is one of the chillest things. I love this team.
