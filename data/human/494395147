Happy #StarWarsDay! In honour of this great event, we once again present John Howard's classic 1834 vision: "Wampa-Dog" taken from his watercolour depicting the corner of York &amp; King Streets. #MayTheFourthBeWithYou @ColborneLodgeTO https://t.co/e4jD5E7qXSApr 27th 1813: the Battle of York, when American soldiers tried capturing York from the shore. A battle at Fort York ended in a British retreat, but not before they deliberately exploded their gunpowder stores. These metal archaeological finds were likely twisted in the explosion https://t.co/jiDUNNLxdTAt @artifactsTO we're experts at moving artifacts, but multiple bicycles was a new challenge. Collections staff modified a regular bike rack with extra supports to keep them upright and intact. See them in our upcoming Bike City exhibition at the Market Gallery (June 30). https://t.co/TjbNG1fIWA@MackenzieHouse Hmmm, this dress looks familiar... oh yes, that's because it's in our collection!!!  #dressforsuccess #TOHistory https://t.co/zR2VZudDCvIn honour of #JerseyDay, #ArtifactsTO would like to share our support of all those affected by @HumboldtBroncos tragedy.
