@nahowes I got, “ I hear you had a nightmare journey”
I said, well, we made it here in one piece, nobody’s hurt. Unlike the people involved in the crash(es) who won’t be going anywhere for some time without tubes in their face...or worse. A one hour delay is much easier to deal with. 🤙🏼@nahowes Yep, we were on our way to Clacton. The M25 was closed because of one accident a mile ahead of us, closely followed by another half a mile behind and one more half a mile ahead of the original one. Knob-heads trying to jump lanes that aren’t actual empty...we had lunch in the car@nahowes Yeah, I did rather run out of time after being held up on the M25 for an hour. Luckily, it was dark for most of the night and everyone else was pissed. I thought I’d got away with it and I would have done, if not for those pesky Finedonians 😖Ready for more?

And you? https://t.co/FxNmWf4nxD@gillianhood2 Round two? https://t.co/KolcEuwc0N@LennieNewman1 @ianhunterchat @GrahamMcKechnie @ben_foden I’ve heard certain rumours to do with a pioneering emigration westwards. I just hope it all works out for the lad. He deserves to do well, has never taken a backward step and has dealt with everything in the same professional manner we’ve become used to. #TopBloke@WheresTommyV Anything to do with this and @LennieNewman1 ‘s interview with a certain young man on The Saints Show earlier today Tom?

https://t.co/Aa8iic0OVn@ianhunterchat @LennieNewman1 @GrahamMcKechnie @ben_foden Crikey, I’d better not tell @gillianhood2 that she’s got even more competition 😰 #Oops@shizlebot @ianhunterchat @LennieNewman1 @GrahamMcKechnie @ben_foden I do like a bit of leg pulling 😉@shizlebot @ianhunterchat @LennieNewman1 @GrahamMcKechnie @ben_foden Who?

The man’s a legend in my eyes (and one of my sisters-in-law absolutely adores him)@GPBailey @wolf3069 A Lennie interview aired on the Saints Show, had the same comments about Foden.@Capt_tuBBymAN @Tyrrells I didn’t know that they made Walkers Ready Salted 🤔@LennieNewman1 @GrahamMcKechnie @ianhunterchat Given the detail within a deleted video interview earlier, what is the view of the panel on Ben Foden’s imminent (but so far not officially disclosed) departure? https://t.co/D6rmjOrn6k@GPBailey @wolf3069 I recall that before I watched it, there were around 60 others who had viewed it....@GPBailey @wolf3069 Or, spoke correctly but out of turn...?@GPBailey @wolf3069 So it is 🤔@wolf3069 I think Loofah may have let the cat out of the bag there.So, Ben Foden is moving on then? No contract for a top professional who can’t stop scoring....?

But it must have been so frustrating to sit and watch the 1st XV get battered and not be given a chance to make a difference.@alastaireykyn Hear hear@wolf3069 Jeez, just read this. Thinking of you bothI remember a time when I thought that Tracey Ullman was funny. 😏@CharlotteHeale @higgy365 👍🏻@WheresTommyV And the consistent form to get there in the first place 😇👍🏻👌🏻@andy_masterman6 @WheresTommyV Don’t you get 5 for a kick from your own half?@AmberB523 Looks neat and tidy 👍🏻@andy_masterman6 @Saintsman99 @SandyMasterman Ah, I see what I did there now 🤭😉@WheresTommyV How big Tom?@Saintsman99 She blocked @SandyMasterman too.

Why do you slice all the uncut loaves before people who can’t get there until after work have a chance to choose?
We want a crusty loaf to slice up how “we” want it, not how you decide. #CrustyGate #DoorstepSarnies 😟@higgy365 @kellycozy @AmberB523 @DarkBunnyTees A happy bunny 👌🏻Fists of “Furry” https://t.co/EaENV91l5k@EnglandRugby @Jason15Robinson @ERRFC Can’t believe you, @davidflatman and @nolli15 were just down the road and didn’t pop in for a cuppa.

Surely, with the lads we’ve got who shone so brightly in the last game, it’s more likely to be 24:36 isn’t it?😇@WheresTommyV Great looking side 👌🏻@nahowes Noisy buggers in their airborne lawnmowers 😉
