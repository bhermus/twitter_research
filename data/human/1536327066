The Other Side of Everything by Mila Turajlic is a touching and spot on documentary about activism in an ex-comunist country. Especially for those of us who do come from one can relate a lot.Another good question I've heard being raised at #IWDK was if should we, at all, consider giving away the responsibility of ethics to systems? I certainly haven't thought about this angle before. I would answer it differently depending if we are picturing a utopia or a distopia.For me #IWDK was more about activism and the role of the internet in politics. One gem I'll take away (paraphrasing): "The platform is given and those who showed up should not use those who didn't as an excuse for not standing up against/for."Perfect sized portions too!

MSZP-P√°rbesz√©d has secured it's seats in the Parliament with over 10% now. Many sectors in Budapest still only has 50% of votes processed. https://t.co/axT0iel7WnPreliminary results can still change, as the 70% is questionable by many sources (some say it's more like 50-60%), and it may affect the 2/3 majority of seats that FIDESZ has and MSZP-P√°rbesz√©d can still get in (and most likely will)JUST IN: Current preliminary results are in and FIDESZ has 2/3 of seats with 67.34% (and retains full power), while Jobbik gains around 27 seats with 13,57%. If MSZP-Dialogue doesn't get more votes in, it will not get into the National Assembly. Processing of votes is around ~70% https://t.co/wuwtoYQ0r9While waiting for the preliminary results of the 2018 Parliamentary Elections, I started reading the national constitution of Hungary, assembled in 2011 by Fidesz: https://t.co/8Mu7fXLo5s It's the first time I'm ever reading such document. Can we end this already?Constituencies are apparently closed by now, but preliminary results are delayed. Apparently the head of the election office, P√°lffy Ilona, has admitted that a multi-million forint IT system has failed at early hours in the morning, and they had to change back to an 8 y/o system.All voting constituencies are closed besides 2 (one in London and one in Budapest's XI. District) and no preliminary results are shown until all of them are closed down. They started processing data from closed ones so we will get a better picture from the start. Expected 10.30PMI truly wonder if votes coming from foreign embassies or via post have been accounted for - but I am fairly certain they were not. Around 436,759 people have registered to vote abroad, and as usual, there's a high turn-out rate out of those.So in more realistic news, the turn-out rate at 6.30PM is 68.13% - which is still impressive. This can end up either as a huge win for Fidesz or a big blow to them. I hope for the latterü§û https://t.co/CIYA0aex0VHow I developed a captcha cracker for my University's website https://t.co/Rz6TYhwmTyThis could set a precedence and overtake the current-highest turn-out rate which was back in 2002 on the 2nd round of the Parliamentary elections with 73.51% (Source: https://t.co/7xcrAz62KI)

Some international media is picking up on the topic too: https://t.co/JeXYu02nKUUpdate: 63,21% turn-out rate as of 5PM and there's still 2 (!) more hours to go. This number is already higher by ~2% than the end-of-day turn-out rate from the 2014 elections. This only proves me that Hungarians really want to take back control, irrelevant of whoever will lead. https://t.co/4MKWo03Skl53,64% turn-out rate as of 3PM local time. Compared to 2014 the same time, that is a +~8% increase (estimate, as no official data for that hour is given). Four more hours to go until the elections are concluded, so still enough time to bring that number much higher üîùüìà https://t.co/xB45vqbxxXTurnout rate visualised by constituency updated by MNO (as far as I can see, though no official source is visible): https://t.co/UVzO5JVg7ELooks like a record turn-out is in the making for the Parliamentary elections: 42,3% by 1PM, which is ~8% more compared to the previous election.
