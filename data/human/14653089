Someone just sent a release about frogurt robots "invading" Australia@MsLods do say hello thenClose enough to the stage I reckon #think2018 #IBM https://t.co/qOfkXBuBIV@Asher_Wolf My kids like watching them too. So tiny.I always wondered what these things were. they're everywhere outside my house. https://t.co/ZNIidrHG94@MillisBrent I have to learn how to prep themAny big security or privacy breach and the bottom feeders come out to play@alexkidman @alliecoyne of course politicians themselves don't have extremely long gaps between sessions/termsToday is officially bonkers@darrenpauli how much shorter though? If I do 6hrs instead of 8hrs I'm awake for the equivalent of a whole month extra per year. That time is pretty useful@juhasaarinen downvote.@juhasaarinen plotting your move to Australia for better internet are you@juhasaarinen @darrenpauli I got a pitch last night about how "cloud is the new black"@ozAntinnippon pretty sure uploading is not allowed@ozAntinnippon arguably you're just used to unrealistically good service. the 4G is alright@juhasaarinen typhoon season is not too far away. it gets real.So my 9'6 and 8'0 just showed up from Oz. Better line up some roof racks.@gmclwill @acccgovau @itnews I'm going with nothing. for a while they didn't write press releases about the quarterly reports.@gmclwill @acccgovau @itnews It'll be more embarrassing (and obvious) come October when a bunch of people get their slow internet back again@darrenpauli apparently i can't like this twice what gives@tonywbrown @danwarne yep and he can probably recommend you a $300 bbq to cook it onThe fate of ~1m 12Mbps #NBN users rests on finding a far better option than anything on the table right now. https://t.co/XwOToFrPpU"Just imagine being able to walk into a Bunnings store and ask the Bunnings Avatar in any language, let's call him 'Bob', what aisle nails are in and he tells you - and he let's you know there is a sale on hammers as well". The future is so exciting@RugbyRiddler Ah. well I was a journo pre-PR too@RugbyRiddler did you go that way? I didn't know thatQuality pitch https://t.co/nD0AhlaKoDI really don't understand why anyone would call out tech journos that changed careers / went into industry / went freelance. Is it really a big deal@jpwarren But it's a secret so sshh@thelaughingsub not sure this kind of thing is in the LTIEJust putting it out there that RBBoNBN is an outstanding new acronymNo one has asked a question about the NBN effect yet@decryption gotta see 'em all https://t.co/lOJvAHsCnrMajor construction works beginning behind the house next week. Nice suits dropped by with notification and a boxed hand towel. #JapanI used to get a manageable 20 or so emails a day. I now get @alliecoyne's emails and it's an endless barrage.@GordyPls @R_Chirgwin @darrenpauli I will say last couple of trips to US for conferences I've been questioned far more vigorously at border (despite having the correct visa, tho not for speaking of course).Thursday the 12th... https://t.co/dfYCPYiBAMCurious dual perspectives this morning, with MacGibbon backing Azure's security posture (https://t.co/kxDQzKrqVx) but Defence backing the ASD guidance on more work (https://t.co/yYG73FDKBV)Defence is backing the need for extra security/config controls before govt agencies use Azure for protected data. https://t.co/yYG73FVm0vSomeone give Linkedin a hand with IT acronyms https://t.co/LKt1hpKQtoI've now received nine copies of the Kogan NBN press releasewho knew there were so many Facebook rentseekersI've had like 7 embargoed infosec reports in like 3 days. who has the time to even look through them@ABillionSuns Addressed late yesterday: "DOCSIS 3.1 is in final stages of deployment. By the middle of this year I think our current planning is we expect to have that feature available for us to release." [eng lead]@briandotjp Is this cheap? I guess the house is nice (tho usual J trick of concreting every available surface). Nara pref is way cheaper. Only one good burger place though@ABillionSuns Difficult to tell right now. We won't know much until we see the trajectory of HFC incorporated officially into the maps.NBN Co is switching about 440,000 HFC premises into its FTTC footprint. That move would be just about the worst kept industry secret ever. https://t.co/KBzJ3736WXAnd, with that, I believe @alliecoyne has left the building. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­@alliecoyne I'm assuming strength is a euphemism for tokensFound this to be a myth. Can get great proper rasher bacon in a supermarket in Nara. Also had great bacon at a tiny place behind Shinjuku. https://t.co/qrc3DJwdHMðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ https://t.co/ihLUWyYIJzCosmetic surgery for fish. Um, ok. https://t.co/2kTMLirrhdOK the captain is now still flying in on a different craft, while the United co-pilot flew American and is "just clearing security". What a mess@darrenpauli yeah, no idea where it is nowNever. fly. United.Missed connections, rebooked into a sizable detour. who knows if we'll ever get there though since the captain is now 2hrs late for his own flight, which was already 2hrs late arriving.A few drops of rain on the west coast and United is in absolute meltdown. I've been travelling almost 12 hours now to go from Vegas to SFOOh good. Massive weather delays. I must be in the US.Are you or anyone you know suffering from "cloud migration regret"Day 3, seems like the projectors in every room are on strike.@stilgherrian they have for a while. Augmented does not imply "replacement" of people but aid of people.The guy in front trying to take tools in his carry-on because his flight leaves in 3 mins.Yes. The keyboards on the newer Apple macbooks are dreadful and get stuck all the time. Disappointing. https://t.co/xGVDL82ZVXI feel sorry for anyone having to venture outside for work today. That wind...@DCoopes The Comms approach sets quite apart from a range of things that contribute to making connections. Personal preference to spend time on the actual rollout :)This is a disappointing start to #NBN estimates. who gives a crap what someone RT'ed. No more substantive topics to raise, in a short period of time?GE were at every conference trying to sell a story of how they disrupted themselves. How'd that turn out then: https://t.co/C5J50h7ukoI'm just amazed a state Labor is criticising 100Mbps speeds on the #NBN as sub-standard. https://t.co/wxRwdQcHk1@ozAntinnippon Is there no situation where the girl from ipanema is not the answerBest sunday present. https://t.co/FGWqVIWgdV5.30pm maths and my brain wants to jump out the window@alliecoyne old hostel trick. the poo can't touch you if you wear double pluggers.@emilio_robles it's for an app to stop you slouching. It's the answer to all your dating problems@emilio_robles Yeah this is just from a pitch"Letâ€™s face it, youâ€™re not going anywhere on Valentineâ€™s Day with damaged spinal discs."Crypto sell-off is :O@R_Chirgwin @GordyPls The assumptions of cash for influence though were way off. Everyone just started buying each other rather than into the NBN directlyA few #NBN bits in the cabinet docs. Who Labor thought it could get cash investments from into the project. What it would give Telstra for some cash. https://t.co/jcm4UBAYdH@GordyPls the docs pre-date the 'going it alone' announcementLove how the email from Goget is simply titled "Notification".This is great https://t.co/06sfobpYa1Write a crypto story watch the shitcoin pitches flow in@j_hutch Fiat is no good, you need a coin that looks and feels and acts like fiat but isn't fiat are you inOh good: a new coin that's "solving one of the biggest problems preventing the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies â€“ the anonymity of transactions." Sounds legit.How about that wind chill Kansai@jpwarren He did though in the letter appended to the audit, and everyone still jumped all over him. He can't win no matter whatSerious snow on the way. I'll believe the 5-20cm around here though when I see it (there's a few bits blowing through today but nothing more) https://t.co/T51AtqtwnbBitcoin "better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange". Savage assessment. https://t.co/5UhPNIVs7GYesterday, snow/sleet and rain. Today, strong winds and sideways rain.Got some new numbers from @Aussie_BB on typical evening peak #NBN speeds. The gap now between players is 18Mbps on the top NBN100 tier...! https://t.co/1qxjnJPYjBPretty interesting thread here on how one party with money can game an altcoin (+ an extra theory on today's crypto crash and burn) https://t.co/uTsS2cFKHc@jpwarren depends if the % losses spook new money or attract it for people wanting to 'get in cheap'Crypto rout is continuing unabated. Gotta wonder where the bottom isNo obligation for a story? Where do I sign up? https://t.co/14ASc5QjjKTelstra have dropped hints in past year that they'd put AI/ML to work on personalising products/offers. Here's the proof - https://t.co/YTQgjryVtQ4.30am news briefing. Let's not make these a habit shall we #imdeadProper snowing outside this morning. The novelty still hasn't worn off.First signs of snow around Kyushu apparently. I'd believe it with how cold the wind is. https://t.co/ngdDswE95t@ozAntinnippon Officially Nara pref. but more like far reach of commuter belt Osaka.Gale force winds around Kansai today@jpwarren I was too embarrassed and figured I was just a doofusPR seems to be back at work today. Endless CES releases because people still don't know the difference between enterprise and consumer.@jpwarren Only ever been defeated by the hotel shower once... had to shower cold.I have this book. Wondered how many others were out there. https://t.co/M2kgB5od7X@GordyPls as long as I can also unbox youToday is like the definition of clusterfuck@NewtonMark @GordyPls @OaaSvc Add Japan to that list, they are *everywhere* (even seen the odd young bloke teaming ankle-high ones with jeans)@AndrewJCann @iTnews_au that's annoying@AndrewJCann @iTnews_au Existing customers I believe can upgrade through self-service panel. NBN Co have also said the promo applies both to new and existing (as long as the RSP passes that through)@zackster @alliecoyne the ACCC advice is clearly to avoid "up to" advertising. idk where we can accurately go with this. "The new NBN50 plan, which could give you anything from 2Mbps to 50Mbps depending on everything, is..."New #NBN price construct is finally out. Positive that it's on both 50 and 100Mbps tiers, but the bundled CVC seems underwhelming. (given figures bandied about) https://t.co/zwC7pbenfg@GordyPls "feel free to yank 'em out sooner, save everyone the hassle"@bengrubb well this is going nowhere@bengrubb strangely Labor aren't NBN Co. ikr how weird@bengrubb No, they specifically did not quantify how much they would dip into the contingency due to HFC. The $500m is just bookable revenue and it's a case of where it lands.@bengrubb Clarifying - The $500m is delayed income, would just be booked later than expected. If delay is longer than 6 months, then part of that $500m would then become lost. Present actual cost is $50mSo the Senate is going over what @iTnews_au already revealed in mid-November on NBN line speeds - https://t.co/rvCltGfz8H
