It rings true everyday as we work with all our kids, but particularly with our vulnerable kids. Love them into learning. https://t.co/SbhvmAezWKOne of the joys of being an administrator in a school for a few years is that you have read a few more chapters and know a little more of the story. It is a privilege as an educator. https://t.co/nqJ290Bh3VLove the rants. Will definitely miss this show. https://t.co/9obvkEHml8Thank you @OvilleLibrary for organizing Engineering Science Quest today. https://t.co/a3RBYYnZ33Inspired this weekend by the movie adaption of @WrinkleInTime.

Might be a great way to gain insight into those students that we have questions about. https://t.co/gcVm9c44IVThe power of wait time. Recalling facts vs innovative and creative thinking. https://t.co/l5dMqx43wGLove this. It is about the power of relationships.
