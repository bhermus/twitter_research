I appreciate each one of youWOAH, just did some googling and found out that Better Days ft. @iamKingLos has over 10,000 extra plays that I didn't even see!!!I want to converse with new people, explore new mindsI know a lot of dudes that joined fraternities just so they could hang out with sorority girls. Talk about pussy power *Drake voice*Starting to notice that the only people who think racism isn't a problem in the US are people that watch the news daily. The news is TRASH 🚮I always want to feel like time is running out...adds unnecessary pressureDon't ever let others convince you that your gut feeling is wrong. This is your life, not theirsThe power of music. Shoutout to my sis @Memoirsofadm 😃🎧 https://t.co/hCezg2CoyqWORDS OF WISDOM. Doesnt even have to be music...any goal you have can be achieved by believing in yourself/hard work https://t.co/yPg2tttfZM
