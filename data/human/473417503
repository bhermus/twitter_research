@WeisAlbert @Alex_Chapman_60 @DEADLINE Hey look, it's Albert https://t.co/peBAC859IX@WeisAlbert @Alex_Chapman_60 @DEADLINE  https://t.co/vgJwAjexM8@WeisAlbert @Alex_Chapman_60 @DEADLINE Who says Disney is going to make them kid friendly?@Alex_Chapman_60 Gotta go with Foreman in this one.@kennygisgod You KNOW Gilmour is the heart and soul of Pink Floyd.Do you Pee in the shower@Katie_Rice12 That's why you become part of the PC Master Race.üòé@WeisAlbert Therefore you need to look at the big picture, I don't agree with what Disney is doing but you shouldn't say they shouldn't own Fox because they don't make Rated R movies, when they do.@WeisAlbert But is it still owned and funded by Disney.... So therefore it's a Disney asset.@WeisAlbert Still under Disney. This is why I have been explaining this to you. It's confusing but Disney owns a bunch of Rated R films. They just don't produce them under the "Disney" name.@WeisAlbert For instance, Walt Disney Motion Pictures owned Miramax for a long time. Miramax made a lot of the Tarantino movies which are Rated R.@WeisAlbert Well Alberto, you are only half right. Disney owns a bunch of different subsidies. Disney has never directly produced a "Rated R" movie, but studios they own make them all the time.@GabbimusPrime BOI@WeisAlbert Albert, we talked about this yesterday. It's going to be alright, Fox will continue to be the same company.@WeisAlbert Sorry Lutz, it's going to happen. There is nothing you can do to stop Disney now.The @FCC should stand up for the consumers it represents and protect #NetNeutrality on December 14
