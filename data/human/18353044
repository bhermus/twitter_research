It used to be much worse.@cmbrandes @hardsci I agree. My point, though, is that we are making a similar mistake in our own research where we read jargonistic, legalistic, and near uninterpretable informed consent documents.@wgervais Nah... the "spotlight" literally creates a circle on the screen and dims the rest of the slide. It can also zoom in on a selection. My mind was blown when I first saw this@dan_wisneski I've put my exfoliating facial scrub in my hair, which already had conditioner in it before...@wgervais Nice.

I agree with standard, but have many problems with haphazard application that often fails to meet standard. Same is true for consenting to apps as it is for our research (which sometimes are intertwined). And...don't get me started on my IRB. Destroying data is sacriligious@Mark_A_Thornton @hardsci I have always wanted to do this study, but couldn't figure out how to obtain consent prior to giving people the informed consent form.@Mark_A_Thornton @hardsci Yea... I don't even understand some of the statements they sometimes ask us to include (e.g., "Data will be preserved and shared according to APA standards..." AND "Raw data will never be shared... [and] Data will be destroyed within 5 to 7 years."). They literally contradict@hardsci And, these apps (especially in the past couple years) literally highlight what permissions (e.g., contacts, GPS, microphone, etc) they want. In some ways, I've thought that the more recent formatting of these requests were more ethical than the jargon required in our consent docs@hardsci I'm confused then. I am not certain of much, but I am fairly certain participants do not read &amp; truly comprehend our consent forms (if they did, they'd realize the contradictory statements in the ones we are required to use @ my uni, &amp; have to know what "APA standards are). (1/n)@hardsci It's as if these apps and third-party providers should do what social science researchers do and obtain participants' informed consent... Oh wait... they do (and probably with the same degree of scrutiny as when participating our social science studies).@hardsci We should assume nothing... except maybe that nothing is truly "free".It kind of blows my mind that people think their online behavior on free social media sites is private. Yet, if you do, here's Zuckerburg reminding us that ppl/orgs/apps are able to see lots of your data... which is how these sites are able to remain free https://t.co/GCzZ4qHastThe mass public seems to be more extreme on authoritarianism, racial resentment, aversion to change, etc than the political elites in new research from @MattGrossmann https://t.co/PjXGQiuV2M@stevenwwebster Congrats, sir!
