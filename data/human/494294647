Getting all my mount runs in.@Dragstaad She was snide, yes.Secondly, I don't care that you worked retail for 30 years in high fashion places and have a key to this store. We are equals here, and I will be treated with the same amount of respect.  Get off your high horse, this store don't have the room for it."You're still young and fresh, no need to worry about work. It's just a job, corporate don't care about you."

First of all, no shit. I know this. That does not mean I am not going to throw everything I have into this job. I was raised to give it my all and work hard.Gotta love when someone assumes because I'm younger and act childish I'm stupid and don't know jack shit about retail or the world we live in. I'm wiser than you give me credit for, sweetheart.@Dirty_emerald Their hotcakes are legit@roxiqt Same.5 hours to go and I'm feeling good!

Tomorrow is the final day until I finally, finally get a day off. Today was over early enough for me to veg out. I wonder if I'll wake up Thursday afternoon in a blind panic to get ready for work.Day 7 out of 8. Hovering between auto pilot and normal. Mentally playing words of encouragement on repeat to get me through the day. https://t.co/bL6yeh6AzHWork day 6 out of 8. The end is in sight, and it will be glorious. Right now I'm almost at the same level exhaustion I was at during warehouse work, but I still greet people with a smile and work with vigor.
