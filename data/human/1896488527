@JoeBudden as a fan who goes back to the exact day y’all leaked the first SH song, I just hope you and Crook are aightI’ve got Verb on this one. This should be good. https://t.co/l6WRvCeUU6Had the entire facilities to myself last night.

No debating.Yoooooo.... this one is cold @MATHHOFFA https://t.co/Omse8CRvRESending out some copies of my new zine on Monday. Still got a couple left for anyone else who likes to look at some good ol’ B&amp;W photographs.

https://t.co/7phiWmIK3M https://t.co/7MysldxWeUStill wanna give it some more time, but @Royceda59 dropped a really good album. That man’s talent really is a blessing to the culture.Victim of questionable A&amp;R’ing from the start of his career, especially with regards to his singles imo. He had all of the right elements though. https://t.co/zKh4npfgjq@JoeBudden At least he ain’t call you Harold Miner lmao@RedFlagNYC All facts. @chillajones is the reason why “scheming” is a thing altogether. He figured out what does/doesn’t work as he went whereas a lot of these other guys took the best parts of his style and Frankenstein’d it.Can’t even lie, I ran back @RumNitty vs. @IronSolomon for the third time today. Both of them reaaaaaaaaaally went off.Took a trip to NYC last July and shot a ton of film as I spent 10 days exploring the city on foot. From that came a series of photos that turned into a zine entitled UPSTREAM.

47 photographs sequences throughout 62 pages.
