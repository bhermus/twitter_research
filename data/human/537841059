@amuricanpai @Poosanbear Welcome to America!! lmfaooo everything just doesn’t make sense anymore@amuricanpai @Poosanbear I hella agree LOL 💆🏻‍♂️💆🏻‍♂️💆🏻‍♂️@Poosanbear people hate being generalized but love to generalize others lmfaoo whack ass people but imig 💀@Poosanbear So my main point: I think it’s wrong to invalidate people’s offense but I don’t think they should speak on behalf of all their people either LOL@Poosanbear Also I think the “offense” mainly comes from how they were brought up. People experience varying levels of racism. My guess is that the ones who were offended are those who faced harsh discrimination.@Poosanbear But I feel like it’s different from other “cultural appropriation” incidents because the dress wasn’t really worn out of context (or at least i think so?). Native headdresses tho I can understand cause it has a sacred/religious context to it@Poosanbear From what I was reading, I think it had more to do with the fact that if it was an asian girl, she’d get mocked for it. Kinda like how some Asians were made fun of for eating “stinky” food but now they’re becoming trendy. But idk not my culture so I can’t speak on it 🤷🏻‍♂️I love coffee but I hate coffee 😩only* tbhbut lmfaooo im one of those who raises their hand during meetings at work 😅pet peeve is when people interrupt others lol like you really boutta disrespect someone to give an opinion no one asked for?@intrusive_n I read that as saliva and I was kinda disturbed for a split second LOLdamn I hella forgot how crazy my dreams get when I’m asleep on sativa@jonnycakesss Happens each quarter can’t be helped 🤷🏻‍♂️why the fuck do people use the machine next to them as a coat rack???@hgngo forreals LOL great minds think alike ✌🏻@thomashewang lmfao forreals and you’d expect them to too 😭@hgngo Wait I’ve been thinking the same 🧐🧐🧐@jsanity117 Nah@sensitivemochis 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻@jonnycakesss I’m deceased this is why I hate birds 🙃@VH1PNUT___ @cbllns bruhhhh I’m fucking deceased 😭😂😩🙃💀@msjennps I feel so attacked but u rite tho 💀the biggest scam ever is having two KOREAN parents and being told that all you need is ‘soap and water’ for skin care ☹️☹️☹️unless you’re like me and will forever be a mess 💀💀💀PSA: look at how much you’ve accomplished while being a mess. now imagine how much you’ll accomplish once you get your life together 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻it’s funny how people talk big about how “people don’t change” but swear they’re not the same person from before lol um whatpeople are gassin up my arms but tbh I think they’re still hella small 🧐🧐🧐it doesn’t really take much for me to be a decent person but it takes even less for me to be a bitch LOL so don’t try megreat that he cares about the environment but if only he put that much energy in being compassionate towards other human beings lmfaooo wtf 💆🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/6bQargCHePlmfaooo so both my big bro and I don’t remember this um why tf are we like this 💀 #GucciGang #hbd https://t.co/QMxqFoDNqi@sensitivemochis Oh shit.. well I’m glad you’re okay ☹️asking God how tf I’m gonna survive two more Vegas trips after this lol I’m already tired 💀 @… https://t.co/n9rGGSG9lghbd big bro 🎉 #25 @ Vdara Hotel &amp; Spa Las Vegas https://t.co/RPI3xTbzFn“wait is this snsd?” “no it’s girls generation” ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm lmfao@sensitivemochis Wtff are you okay??it’s a shame no one dances at clubs anymore smh why spend money in Vegas just to stand?
