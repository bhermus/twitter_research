https://t.co/BvfGD2g1q9LeBron God damn James@Ginnyisahabit @smithers4pres No lies told here@Ginnyisahabit With mookie having 4 yrs less under his belt im liking his stats more but i feel ya 😉 https://t.co/WGLAbHGK5x@Ginnyisahabit U spelt mookie betts wrong dawg.@qtrain5 There about to run the eastOff the field issues aside, the browns just got the best WR in the draft in the 4th round. Fix the off field stuff n thats going be a steal of a pick.I like the first 2 picks by green bay. CB was a huge need and got a steal with jackson going to 2nd rd@Ginnyisahabit True that man!@Ginnyisahabit Dont disrespect Terry Francona like that.Green Bay getting Fitzpatrick would also be cool with meIf u havent played Draft Day by Drake at least one time today, then your doing today wrong.@ShazzMumphrey5 @qtrain5 Ya valid point. Thats pry least of the concerns o have but out of 2 yrs he was a starter throwing 44tds n 21 ints with comp% 56. Just doesnt sell me as a guy who will thrive in NFL@qtrain5 @ShazzMumphrey5 Lol naw its all good. Love other opinions and convo about it@LoganJepsen33 Id agree with that as wellHe has arm strength and thats about it. Decision making/accuracy pretty questionable to me. Didnt stand out numbers wise in such weak conf. Id take darnold,rozen, baker and Jackson before him lol. https://t.co/igdeTsbCFe@Ginnyisahabit I think qb that could be a steal. Lamar jackson. Id love see him go jags. Him with fournette and that D coulr make things scaryNeed Green Bay to trade up tonight an snag WardJosh Allen will be a bust#RedSox https://t.co/BVreXE0mzw@ahmadblack35 RIP 🐐@qtrain5  https://t.co/8MvsjlFx81Red soxs should be 10-0 right now, but ill take the 9-1 and 9 game winning streak@Titans @Ginnyisahabit you like um?Steal*Colts would be getting a sfeal. Callaway has 1st rd potential. Off field issues only reason he isnt 1st rd quality pick. https://t.co/6DwLBsNDHd@Ginnyisahabit Deal. Since chicago is closer and fact ive been fenway and never stepped foot in wrigley i supposr we can catch one there lol@Ginnyisahabit Red soxs vs cubbies world series. Bank on itColorado &gt; any other state https://t.co/rD5rlsfyPq@tyler2544 @sportsinkansas @qtrain5@SportsCenter @qtrain5@Ginnyisahabit @Browns @saquonb21 Valid point. Pry smarter bet take shaq at 1 then have pick between whos left at 4 with rosen,darnold,allen n mayfield@Ginnyisahabit @Browns @saquonb21 They have picks 1 and 4. I think they could gamble and take qb at 1 and still get barkley at 4. Only team would be giants at 2 that might take him but with eli being old n sketchy they might go qb as well@Ginnyisahabit @smithers4pres And thats why i think he goes LA. Add bron and pg13 to the roster next year n thats solid team. LBJ wants an enviroment suited after he retires n LA perfect place for gigs add in him lookin for schools for his kids to attend their n his close friends livin their. Think he goes LA@Ginnyisahabit @smithers4pres Ya there talented enough to win the east but the key point was win ships. He wont do it in clev. Way better odds join Htown with cp3 n harden or LA with PG13 n that roster n whatever FA that follows.@smithers4pres @Ginnyisahabit Hes going west forsure. Id sa LA Houston being front runners then maybe SA. Bron hates Dan Gilbert and only came back to win a ship for city he loves. He wont stick around to keep winning for him. The trades arnt enough talent for him win a ship again@Ginnyisahabit Bron defff not staying in Clev@qtrain5 @LoganJepsen33 I was talkin loggy bout this last night@smithers4pres @ACR_POKER Damn duse that sucks.
