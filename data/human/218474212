Get off time!  #RAW #ZiggyMac@OmarKelly You getting a copy @OmarKelly @DomWheat21 I gotta get mine on Friday/payday. üòÇ@OmarKelly And to think they wanted her to correct his speech in this book. That's why it's just being published. But still a GREAT read.  #Each1Teach1@DomWheat21 U should have told him to "suck on some penguin balls" and left it at that bro!The good old days! @DomWheat21 @WizIamStraitup @NBAWorldNewz https://t.co/kKGkqDwpgD@James__Harder @boxnewsuk WIFE'S forehead, and I love it! Mother of 5, wife of 16yrs. And she's probably finer than anyone that you have EVER been with. So leave her out of this, and eat the fact that AJ is fucking ducking @BronzeBomber and lay off the carbs you fat fuck!@ScoutsEliteNFL @travishomer4 get'em!  They don't even know!  #Homer4Heisman Tell'em I said it.  #Canes #CaneGang #BeatLSU@boxnewsuk @James__Harder but he's not running.  The money is there now but he can't be bought.  Fucking paper champ like I said https://t.co/V5vTqKqlRT@CFreemanJAX @WizIamStraitup Blimptown! üòÇ@The_U1 Between kodi and Gears TV.  I miss absolutely nothing! üòÇ üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç I love my firestick!@DolphinsTalk See his Baylor scheme and tell me this isn't a good move!@James__Harder @Tribe1970 @Matty_Est1980 @Bitter_Tweet44 @BronzeBomber  https://t.co/OjUZcncmYv@James__Harder @Tribe1970 @Matty_Est1980 @Bitter_Tweet44 @BronzeBomber Never said I couldn't handle it. Just hate arguing with "always right" people.@James__Harder @Tribe1970 @Matty_Est1980 @Bitter_Tweet44 @BronzeBomber Eat a sack of monkey dicks! I just want the two brawlers to fight. Please spare me the f'ing politics!@BertyBumBollox @Matty_Est1980 @Tribe1970 @Bitter_Tweet44 @BronzeBomber 3 of 4 belts is impressive, but 4 of 4 belts put a hw into unprecedented company. But instead he'd rather fight garbage. I just want a unification bout of the century, between 2 undefeated hw's. You take the rest of that list and scrapbook that ish. https://t.co/B3nrWbYUeS@BertyBumBollox @Matty_Est1980 @Tribe1970 @Bitter_Tweet44 @BronzeBomber Man if that wasn't the worst list of fighters I've ever witnessed some one put on paper. All jokes except for AJ. And even then stop talking about the money, I always loved belt collector's. AJ can become one IF he stops running from belt holders.@Matty_Est1980 @Tribe1970 @Bitter_Tweet44 @BronzeBomber This cat AJ fighting in the UK circuit! üòÇ@LouieVRee @DomWheat21 @WizIamStraitup üòÇ lol@CanesAllAccess @CanesWTennis #LegacyU https://t.co/51NbSQTvad@ChaseGoodbread Just means that he can really grip the ball well.
