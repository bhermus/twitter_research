I’m so tempted to max out my card now 😂😭wishing I had friends in EP that would come over just to bring me a soda 😂@AubryElean Lmfao I laughed getting my piercings. My sister&amp; friend were in the room. They all thought I was crazy 🤣 but I guess 16g because of my tiny nipples. I used plastic ones to size up so it wasn’t that painful putting them in until after. I didn’t want to touch them 😭soda is my addiction and I’m craving one so bad right now@AubryElean He pierced mine as 16g but I sized up to 14g. That shit was painful 🤣@AubryElean The guy gave me curved ones when he did mine but I guess it’s because I have small boobs 😂 but I tried straight &amp; most of them are kind of long but I do have small nipples 🤣@AubryElean Tbh I think the size has a lot to do with it. I had a long bar on one nipple, short bar on the other &amp; the long one was always getting caught on shit 😭 my fave kind are the curved barbellsI miss my baby Taylor, hope to see him soon ☹️🚮🚮🚮🚮@AubryElean It actually happened to me a few days ago. I was like “ohhhhhfuuuuccckk” ☹️ but I finally switched my piercings out so I’m hoping it doesn’t happen as often now lol@AubryElean Like even though you’re used to some pulling, it’s just really painful when it happens with a loofah 😂😭I cry a little every time this happens to me 😫💀 https://t.co/GpNXnS3ddW@jammerusa Like chucky doll, walking &amp; talking kind of doll.

Don’t let a boy control you!literally had to force myself to wake up this morning@WellDAMN_Jackie I guess some people just see marriage as a relationship lmao but it’s way more than that. Divorce isn’t something to be proud of.@ala_amc And overwhelming lolIf you have to blame other people for your shitty life, you ain’t shit. Own up to your decisions. You’re in the position you’re in because YOU choose to be.@WellDAMN_Jackie I think some people do it for the money. I have a friend who’s wife is on her 3rd marriage &amp; 4th deployment, they’re devorcing after being together for 8months 🤔 the crazy part is my friend supports herself financiallyMade an alcoholic beverage and my husband said it smells like death 😂@ChellyT92 Some chicken fettuccine sounds deliciousssss 😋I love getting the big bag of hot Cheetos at Sam’s club 😋@_PitaaPan I dislike steamed rice but I still think it’s better than fried rice.
