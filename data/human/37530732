‚úî https://t.co/z7n6MsDpvYJust a few weeks left. You've got this. https://t.co/xsRYgVyWL3Sometimes in order to get a student to go back to class, you tell them to lose their "Cheese Touch" by giving it to the bookshelf. And sometimes that backfires when another student claims that shelf of books can't be touched now. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßÄ #cantmakethisup#APWeek18 has been so sweet. @ABESCardinals is the best place to be. ‚ù§ https://t.co/gnJvQFPhhAThis is the best job ever! ‚ù§ @ABESCardinals #APWeek18 https://t.co/PJFZdcboYJ@RedDevil_Miller @m_wolfenbarger Haha yes! #NorthKnoxRox #NorthKnoxIsConfused@ABESCardinals is the BEST place to be! #APWeek18 https://t.co/JpxczSPBtiFeeling pretty special today as I was met with gifts for #APWeek18.

You're welcome.@niftykrisha @rollinprince @KnoxAnvil @rollinprince This. Is. Incredible.There are many ways to TEACH reading, but only one way our brains LEARN to read.
@StanDehaene #LauraStewart #PlainTalkNOLA  
https://t.co/YPE12b2QRxKindergarten teachers - how many of these words would HAVE to be taught as "memory words" because they can't be decoded?  Keep in mind at this point, students know their short vowels and consonants. 
#ReadingIsNotMemorization #LauraStewart #PlainTalkNOLA https://t.co/45J0Kgg1tfReading really IS rocket science. 
#LauraStewart #PlainTalkNOLA https://t.co/gkpKI2DyRwAsking about WHAT behaviors students are exhibiting only tells us that they are stuck, not the reasons WHY. Challenging kids are challenging because they don't know how NOT to be. 

If the kids could do well, they would.

#RossGreene #PlainTalkNOLA
https://t.co/zc60rzu16dGive students the opportunity to "stand and teach" every time you teach something new.  Let them take ownership of that new learning by sharing it with someone else!
#AnitaArcher #PlainTalkNOLA@CCutter "Is she brilliant?  Ready?  Everyone ...!"
"Yes!!"
;)Did you know that the use of small, personal white boards in the classroom has been proven to increase student engagement AND their ability to actually retain information when they are used to show student responses?  Well, they are!
#AnitaArcher #PlainTalkNOLAIf reading complex text is how students show the most growth, what if they struggle with fluency?

Let them read it aloud by themselves first to work on their fluency without the stress of comprehension.

#PlainTalkNOLAHow often have you had students who didn't know where they were until you told them?

@NancyFrey 

#AssessmentCapableVisibleLearners #PlainTalkNOLA@enriquehank Thank YOU!  Truly inspired by your session!The moment you say to your students, "I need your attention," you've already lost it.

It is up to US as educators to ignite curiosity. 

@enriquehank #PlainTalkNOLAMemory is the residue of thought.

Confront students' familiarity by having them THINK.  Have them "turn-and-talk".  Give them knowledge or skill-based exit tickets.  Have them test themselves after not seeing their notes for at least 30 minutes.  

@DTWillingham #PlainTalkNOLAHow can we help students remember what we teach them?
1. Assignments that make them think of meaning.  Don't TELL them to think, give them something CONCRETE to do.
2. Repetition that is spaced.  It has a bigger impact and is less boring.
@DTWillingham #PlainTalkNOLAThere are certain things that you remember even without being intentional.  In fact, WANT to remember has very little effectiveness on whether or not you actually do. @DTWillingham #PlainTalkNOLAA certain amount of adversity is helpful for learning how to manage failure. But children can't learn it on their own. You need an environment that embraces failure as a part of learning. @paultough #PlainTalkNOLA #growthmindset"We can often confuse stress and challenge." - Paul Tough #PlainTalkNOLALet's go! #PlainTalkNOLA https://t.co/PQvbRlUpGiReady to get my mind blown at #PlainTalkNOLA! @cdlteach https://t.co/qq0Neyu4upüìö #ArmMeWith https://t.co/zy7Z1Lrfpp#EndItMovement‚ùå https://t.co/h1VY4w2bBiDon't give us guns and create more potential safety concerns, give us the funds to staff our schools with more personnel so we can better support our students. https://t.co/csEEeKJl3B@tjnix @CCutter @KCSInstruction @maestro1913 @HintonAlisha @tracymarsh123 @SterchiElem @BlueGrass_K5 I only pretended I was a winner. üòâ#personalizedlearning means students have ownership in what, how, when, and where they learn.
