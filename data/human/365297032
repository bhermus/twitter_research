If anyone has any contacts with any players that have encountered any form of racism or bigotry, please DM me. Thank you! https://t.co/7TlvjZ700dHello, @MuntariOfficial can we interview for a piece on racism in soccer for AJ+?@atk098 dude, been cutting down on turkish coffee slowly.@atk098 Wait hands are falling from the sky too? Bro what are you smoking@atk098 I’m confused, is the sky falling or is ice falling from the sky? Be more clear sir.For the record, Syrians die everyday from air strikes carried out by Russia but you don’t see any outrage from these dumbass leftistsAnd for the record, i'm not entirely in support of these airstrikes, but I will support whatever Syrians on the ground demand. This is something they wanted for a long time but since nobody listens to them, its our job to give them a voice.Leftists: I’m confused, is it #HandsOffSyria or #HandsOffAssadTruth https://t.co/g1QTRjLAnWYou think Syrians wanted this? You think they wanted to be bombed by the U.S? Of course not! But how else are the Syrians expected to live normal lives when their own President is destroying their home?Assad has had the helping hands of outside players since 2012 and not a word has been uttered. But when the west strikes, all hell breaks looseAlso, if you’re going to say #handsoffSyria, be sure to also direct that to Russia, Iran, Iraq, Hezbollah, etc. 

HypocritesHaven’t seen a single non-Syrian trash leftist blame Assad for the other 600,000+ civilians he’s slaughtered.No Jamie, your opinion doesn’t matter, and even if it did, it’ll always be shit https://t.co/BH0KjUlv6fYou wanna learn about what’s REALLY going on in Syria? Talk to real Syrians living IN SYRIA...don’t refer to Jake for your daily dose of the Middle East.Small request: please stop retweeting white people tweets about #Syria.@NoraEl7orra ExactlyThis thread can go on for days, but just know that crimes against Syrian people came way before the uprising in 2011.Why give the blind eye when Assad forces post videos of themselves torturing innocent SyriansWhy give the blind eye when Assad starved his own people in Moudamia?Why give the blind eye when Assad arrests and tortured children so much that their own families can’t even recognize their bodies anymore?Why give the blind eye when Assad stepped into Houla and massacred hundreds of innocent civilians (half of them being children)?For the record, trashy leftists decided to speak about #Syria just recently. They completely disregard the partnership b/w Assad and Russia, who have been bombing the shit out innocent towns since 2011Umm these strikes won’t benefit anyone. Assad will continue to bomb #Syria with the help of Russia. The only people really losing here are the lives of innocent Syrians.@edgarallanro Who are youOne the pieces I’m proud of putting together. https://t.co/Kxx4NY0TOZThey DO NOT deserve to winJuventus was straight robbed.

WAKE THE F**K UP!!A big f**k you to "woke" leftists who think they are experts on #Syria . Have some respect for the families affected by the recent chemical attack in #Douma.  Assad has been gassing his own people since 2011. Don't stir some shit conspiracy theory for views.Ok I’m sorry, this whole punish a Muslim day thing is total bullshit.

#MyWeekAsAMuslimLeave it to the white savior to explain what Muslims “really do.” If you want to know about a our daily lives, walk into a mosque and ASK.If you knew anything about Islam, you’d know that we come from different backgrounds.Trying to “look” like us doesn’t help. In fact you add more to the problem. Total arrogance.They “brownfaced” a white woman, gave her a nose job and threw on a hijab. All of this was done just so she can “fit in.”In an effort to “understand” Muslims, Channel 4 ran a segment called “My week as a Muslim”Islamophobia is real people. You will not believe the shit I just watched.Correction: I meant Turkey.Though to be fair, Alaa al-Shibly was not present in the photo with Assad.

#سوريا_استرالياِIt’s a means to show the people that things are back to normal in Syria under Assad...which isn’t the caseRegardless, I can’t support this team knowing what’s going on in Syria. Assad will continue to use this team as a propaganda toolThat’s could be a possibility. It’s really not clear whether this team supports Assad or not.A lot of people say some of these players have no choice but to play and that if they did have a choice they wouldn’t play at all.Fadi Dabbas, VP of The Syrian National Football Association, continuously praises the “political leadership” in almost every interview https://t.co/5fBmyzJ5AvAnd around 13 are either missing or in jail.Since 2011, the Syrian gov’t has targeted Syrian athletes. Roughly 39 players from division 1 and 2 have been killed by Assad forces.So heartbreaking. I truly can’t look the other way. #سوريا_استرالياHow can I leave politics aside when I see fan holding pictures of Assad and chanting his name?How can I support the team when they are openly supporting Assad on live TV?But I can’t. The team is casting a shadow over all the atrocities that are committed by the very govt they represent.Part of me says to leave politics aside and support Syria.I feel so conflicted watching Syria play in the World Cup qualifier.It’s a good thing they didn’t find a prayer rug in his hotel, otherwise shit would be very different. https://t.co/B804FRg4C986% of mass shootings are committed by the white man. #LasVegasShooting#AGameOfTones https://t.co/jGaE3w3UYLWTF, I’m picturing Trump saying this in a whiney voice https://t.co/AJUhvlmwNyThis is an actual question on the US immigration form.
