If anyone has any contacts with any players that have encountered any form of racism or bigotry, please DM me. Thank you! https://t.co/7TlvjZ700dHello, @MuntariOfficial can we interview for a piece on racism in soccer for AJ+?@atk098 dude, been cutting down on turkish coffee slowly.@atk098 Wait hands are falling from the sky too? Bro what are you smoking@atk098 I‚Äôm confused, is the sky falling or is ice falling from the sky? Be more clear sir.For the record, Syrians die everyday from air strikes carried out by Russia but you don‚Äôt see any outrage from these dumbass leftistsAnd for the record, i'm not entirely in support of these airstrikes, but I will support whatever Syrians on the ground demand. This is something they wanted for a long time but since nobody listens to them, its our job to give them a voice.Leftists: I‚Äôm confused, is it #HandsOffSyria or #HandsOffAssadTruth https://t.co/g1QTRjLAnWYou think Syrians wanted this? You think they wanted to be bombed by the U.S? Of course not! But how else are the Syrians expected to live normal lives when their own President is destroying their home?Assad has had the helping hands of outside players since 2012 and not a word has been uttered. But when the west strikes, all hell breaks looseAlso, if you‚Äôre going to say #handsoffSyria, be sure to also direct that to Russia, Iran, Iraq, Hezbollah, etc. 

HypocritesHaven‚Äôt seen a single non-Syrian trash leftist blame Assad for the other 600,000+ civilians he‚Äôs slaughtered.No Jamie, your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, and even if it did, it‚Äôll always be shit https://t.co/BH0KjUlv6fYou wanna learn about what‚Äôs REALLY going on in Syria? Talk to real Syrians living IN SYRIA...don‚Äôt refer to Jake for your daily dose of the Middle East.Small request: please stop retweeting white people tweets about #Syria.@NoraEl7orra ExactlyThis thread can go on for days, but just know that crimes against Syrian people came way before the uprising in 2011.Why give the blind eye when Assad forces post videos of themselves torturing innocent SyriansWhy give the blind eye when Assad starved his own people in Moudamia?Why give the blind eye when Assad arrests and tortured children so much that their own families can‚Äôt even recognize their bodies anymore?Why give the blind eye when Assad stepped into Houla and massacred hundreds of innocent civilians (half of them being children)?For the record, trashy leftists decided to speak about #Syria just recently. They completely disregard the partnership b/w Assad and Russia, who have been bombing the shit out innocent towns since 2011Umm these strikes won‚Äôt benefit anyone. Assad will continue to bomb #Syria with the help of Russia. The only people really losing here are the lives of innocent Syrians.@edgarallanro Who are youOne the pieces I‚Äôm proud of putting together. https://t.co/Kxx4NY0TOZThey DO NOT deserve to winJuventus was straight robbed.

WAKE THE F**K UP!!A big f**k you to "woke" leftists who think they are experts on #Syria . Have some respect for the families affected by the recent chemical attack in #Douma.  Assad has been gassing his own people since 2011. Don't stir some shit conspiracy theory for views.Ok I‚Äôm sorry, this whole punish a Muslim day thing is total bullshit.

Assad will continue to use this team as a propaganda toolThat‚Äôs could be a possibility. It‚Äôs really not clear whether this team supports Assad or not.A lot of people say some of these players have no choice but to play and that if they did have a choice they wouldn‚Äôt play at all.Fadi Dabbas, VP of The Syrian National Football Association, continuously praises the ‚Äúpolitical leadership‚Äù in almost every interview https://t.co/5fBmyzJ5AvAnd around 13 are either missing or in jail.Since 2011, the Syrian gov‚Äôt has targeted Syrian athletes.
