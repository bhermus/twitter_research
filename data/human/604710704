Go get em Shaquem, definitely be following his career! https://t.co/JIXiPefpLfLast home game of the season 💙 https://t.co/8IuRWezzsI@tinners19 @cazjmay Follow me and I’ll dm@tinners19 @cazjmay Yes mate yours if you want it.Any Bristol Rovers fans want a free ticket for tomorrow, West Terrace. Will be around Glos Rd tomorrow if anyone wants to come grab it, give me a shout.🐐 🐐 🐐 https://t.co/ebVMDx1yiMI'm all for Shahid Khan buying Wembley if it means more NFL games (although I already spend a small fortune) and stuff like no Semi Finals and meaningless friendlies at Wembley, but no fan anywhere is gunna stop supporting their current NFL teams for the London Jags.Woah. https://t.co/vRHkg7nTgXA tear?! Don’t be silly, I’ve just got something in my eye. Legend 😍 https://t.co/EZDy4F6EuQShit like this is gunna make me stay up until 6am to watch the draft. Just no consideration to the UK fans by Zim 😂 Work tomorrow is gunna be hell https://t.co/8crFTDsgbu@cazjmay Have you got a new dog?@Terry_Nutkin Tezza I wish I could retweet thisIt’s the right time for this but actually made me sadder than I ever thought, hell of a character. Just wish that one that hit the post today crept in. Need to listen to promotion goal on repeat tonight. https://t.co/UH2aCcTAk7@cazjmay I love watching Charis May post basic Rovers tweets to get tonnes of likes. Proper Blue 💙 haha lol utg xox@cazjmay Now the sunshine has come out he’s gone all country but he’s ghosting me because he’s gone away for the weekend 👻😢 https://t.co/IcCXDlUfnc@cazjmay 😂😂😂😂😂😂👀👀👀👀 waiting for this all day @ me next time yeah@mickeypcollins Very street. https://t.co/RWGbUUjFPEBe funny to see Arsenal fans going all respectful of Wenger and talking about his legacy etc 😂 nothing but respect for him, huge part of the 🐐 PL era.Need to finish work so I can listen to that new J Cole now plz.@LuceFord_ Not going to lie, I kinda wish I missed One Born... Which might just reinforce my mum’s thought to be fair. 🤢@LuceFord_ Only slightly discouraging 😂Watching the tail end of One Born Every Minute before First Dates and I declare “I’ll have to stay top end if it ever happens to me” to my family. To which MY OWN MOTHER replies “It’ll be a miracle if it ever happens to you”. Bloody charming! 😂@HailMaryHits Count me in #HailMaryHits@cazjmay  https://t.co/0lfUJtoQtT@cazjmay 21 - 6. Which basically proves my point, especially as my pic is waaay prettier 💅🏻@Terry_Nutkin @cazjmay We go again@Terry_Nutkin @cazjmay Love you Terry 😘@cazjmay Drawing 2-2. Bet you're FUMING. 😂@cazjmay I’d be pretty worried if my pic started getting loads of likes flooding in. Could be my new catfish pic.@cazjmay See, this is gunna get 100's of likes whereas if i posted my virtually identical pic with DC it would get like two at best. https://t.co/zgYAk7JPwPAnd they’re virtually red. What a time to be alive. 😂 https://t.co/VznZzYc3LSAhahahahhahshhhshhaha

Bristol Bears

😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/5wy5R6VkitThink it’s time to accept that I’m old af, that I can’t drink like I used to be able to, dojos is never a good shout and sleeping on a sofa is a sure fire way to make my body be in agony for the next few days. 👴🏻@mickeypcollins Mate Joshua asked but they're still available I think https://t.co/Nl5MwaUXGzUFC Liverpool tickets are legitimately harder to get than Arctic Monkeys tickets and that’s saying something 😂 https://t.co/tVVtFcK4BMWas struggling to get through on Arctic Monkey's tickets so much that I just went ahead and bought the Dublin leg tickets. Who fancies a trip? 😂😂When UFC Liverpool gets sold out on presale in less than a minute. https://t.co/iggTFKYHBZBloody hell, just seen the City Taylor gif - even the most salty of our lot stopped giving a shit about it ages ago. Been waiting to use it a year 😂😂Honestly can’t believe how long it’s taken teams to figure out the best way to deal with City is by having the balls to go forward against them. All at sea defensively but too many teams rather get passed to death then have a go.Honestly my respect for @ALIAQUINTA was sky high after 223 and now after listening on MMA hour the guy is my favourite fighter, what a don. Hope to see him live one day.Wrestlemania time 😎Forgetting about Khabib being slightly underwhelming - I just became Al Iaquinta’s biggest fan. #ufc223I need to hear the Matt Serra full match commentary after this #ufc223😂😂 https://t.co/lf6EBOSnvLI mean that’s not 49-46 but what a fight. Rose movement is something else. Spookily calm and composed. #UFC223I still have no idea on how this fight goes down. #UFC223I could watch that fight for all eternity 😂 #ufc223So this morning I woke up fully clothed to a phone call saying if I didn’t get out of my hotel room in 15 mins I would be charged another night. I was also completely covered in glitter. Starting to think I should drink less on nights out.@niallcollins91 Like I think it's going to be uncomfortable viewing bad.@LilyBlifestyle 😂😂@niallcollins91 Pettis is going to get abused.@niallcollins91 I nearly threw my computer out the window at work.This fucking week man. First Ferguson, then McGregor, now this. This is #1 bullshit. Just jailbreak Conor &amp; give him 25 mins with Khabib and save this card. Or Lobov for shits and giggles. https://t.co/jdRy9o9IJiMcGregor was the top news story on Radio 1 news this morning. Always proud when MMA hits the mainstream media.😂😂 https://t.co/fB8lGRtg6RI mean at least this McGregor storming the media day stuff is entertaining in the most #1 bullshit WWF attitude era way. It's better than the usual twitter wars.McGregor has upgraded bottles to barricades. https://t.co/kZYykpAjsmImagine my shock. https://t.co/ufC1Iscipp👍🏻👍🏻 Cody has it this time https://t.co/F31Yh1DcN0Imagine doing a list of Arctic Monkeys best songs and not putting 505 in there like gtfo with your invalid opinions.Every part of me just wants to sleep but nah. https://t.co/72nFGXskNOHeading to Thekla for my brothers birthday on Friday for the first time since I was about 22 &amp; went every Thursday &amp; Saturday without fail. Better see if I can dust out the old low/v-neck tee, hoodie, jacket, skinny jeans, hi-tops &amp; flat peak combo 😂@Terry_Nutkin To be honest I didn't even set the bets, it was a syndicate thing.Just won a lovely £288 💰🤙🏻 https://t.co/vc8dvRdDeKRonnie that is filthyVery intrigued to find out what this lad is going to have on the back of his jersey when he gets drafted. I used to think T.J. Houshmanzadeh was a tricky one to fit in 😂 https://t.co/dRzfB9hW0aTonight will commence my week consisting of 99.9% watching sports, as opposed to the usual 60% or 70%.@Official_BRFC Prefer Telford but not a fan of people celebrating a player getting injured 🤷‍♀️@niallcollins91 Seems so mate, been posted by Dana and Ariel. I mean I can't actually blame anyone for not fighting Khabib on short notice, but don't post all this stay ready bullshit as if you'd take the fight and then bail.@niallcollins91 Such a pisstake. Don't get me wrong love Holloway and so much credit for him stepping up but I wanted that fight bad.@cazjmay Too classy for Kingswood establishments. You do owe one though.@mickeypcollins He surely would have been the logical first call for Dana, so either he bailed or their waiting to do it on a bigger card, either way it doesn't look great for him that Holloway stepped up and he didn't.@niallcollins91 😭Fucking gutted about the Ferguson pull out, was praying that was an April Fool. Still a good fight, really telling that Holloway gets the call over McGregor, even after McGregor was saying about staying ready. Can only think he didn't want any of Khabib on short notice.@cazjmay Gtfo https://t.co/J5pkYwQNgD@cazjmay 🐍Shite reffing, shite commentary. Deserved win but unimpressed by JoshuaThompson vs Till and Gunni in the co main. Shut up and take my money. https://t.co/p306ghGRkpA little piece of me dies inside every time I hear Tony Ferguson trash talk. Khabib destroys him in his second language 😂@cazjmay Hey Caz, sorry i'm running a little late for Friday. Might be able to get there at around two for a quick pint at the Oak.@cazjmay Yes, Fri, 12 - Hob, Casual &amp; we both know you ain't washing your hair, tanning or shaving for my sake.@cazjmay u dnt own me tho hun 💁‍♀️xox https://t.co/aZQBvbylYb@cazjmay @LuceFord_ Conditional lunching: first round is on you and we’re getting a Hobgoblin 💅🏻@cazjmay @LuceFord_ 👀👀👀 https://t.co/KMx6SeVBD0@niallcollins91 Not even a little excited when you see the promos?@AshBammy Going for Khabib and Rose but it’s two pretty damn close title fights!Don't get me wrong, I'm looking forward to #JoshuaParker - but nothing will compare to UFC 223 next week.There will be plenty saying he’s an idiot or he doesn’t have a clue about our situation but there’s not a lot I can disagree with here 🤔 Well, maybe the Nichols part 😂 https://t.co/b43pJtu808@cazjmay @AdamMCraig 👀👀👀Maximum Excitement. https://t.co/YqebGH1RPy@cazjmay So unlucky mate can’t believe Crawley done that to you 😢, you deffo deserve some big winners! #GirlsThatGamble https://t.co/Pj1mNzICmZ@cazjmay No it’s good, but I bet you get really frustrated when you lose by just a single leg or something 😡😡😡@cazjmay Didn’t know you do accas m8?!@kane_photo https://t.co/ULz02gnNlBBig! #skol https://t.co/W2Mf9CRjaoWell in Native River 💵👍🏻@paddypower #PPCheltenham https://t.co/yoZFNxfFAp@uk_vikings  https://t.co/q55PE8ztdO@uk_vikings We’re apparently in the running for honey badger, I’ll try and find the post.@cazjmay Was it the one using your surname or the gallagher one?@cazjmay But when ur horse lose u be like 😢 https://t.co/7QHoLcWU7YSanchez may turn it around eventually but the transfer has been horrible for Utd in the short term. Mourinho is very damaged goods right now and I’m not sure he ever will. Miles away.Didn’t go to Cheltenham 👎🏻
Good start betting for Cheltenham though 👍🏻 https://t.co/vh1o4sH6AZ@mickeypcollins Give us a job.@mickeypcollins 😢Oh shit. 🙏🙏🙏 https://t.co/qWa6CjbpwhCoach Carter is such a 🐐 filmYou realise it might be time to start reevaluating what you do with your time when you stay 40 minutes after work to design and create a Mother’s Day card for your Mum but from your Dog 🤔King Kong, imma let you finish, but this is easily the swaggiest Gorilla of all time. https://t.co/XdjWyE02PKAll these ads popping up for Cheltenham and it seems like i'm not going this year and i'm gutted 😩Can’t help but feel McDonald’s missed a trick not getting him to promote McNuggets. https://t.co/E0yJDg3NMuRegardless of who this guy gets drafted by, I'll be rooting for him.

https://t.co/OVnhGRubMK https://t.co/1O5K4pJneNThose #UFC223 promos are 🔥, as if anyone needed to get anymore hyped.Does anyone else get really bored of seeing top prem clubs with millions go into playing Man City like a league two team has drawn them in the F.A. Cup?@cazjmay That + train + the cost of drinking you under the table = 😩😩This has been said but honestly every time I catch one of those nationwide adverts with the two girls singing my soul dies a little bit more. 😩 horrendous.@cazjmay  https://t.co/5fywcgjDzYHope the game is on tonight, t-shirt weather #utg@cazjmay Sorry for not conforming to your fiat 500 taste. As you were xo@cazjmay  https://t.co/QLUaIgECLX@offtheball_20 @MaxAlder16 Really? Leeds under Cellino at the time where he sacked a manager every couple of months which would have really hurt DC’s managerial stock. Besides, you do really get me feeling things he was told to stay haven’t actually come into fruition hence some of his frustrations.@Terry_Nutkin @MaxAlder16 I agree and it's been the main point I've spoken about. As much as it may be wrong to slate the man, it also really bugs me when he's regarded to as some sort of hero. I've even seen some lay blame at DC's door occasionally, which is madness to me.@MaxAlder16 I’ve had doubts but I’d love to be proved wrong and will be the first holding my hands up and apologising.@MaxAlder16 It’s hard to say right now. I feel Wael will be seriously judged if/when DC ever leaves. We’ve progressed every season because of the fantastic manager as the main real board initiated change has been the development squad and that’s not really truly impacted yet.@MaxAlder16 No, but you did make the comparison of the two. In the exactly the same form, if it's too early to judge in a two year timescale that he's not gotten much done of note, is it too early to judge that he's been a success?@MaxAlder16 But is that the remit to judge a chairman? He's doing an excellent job because he's less shit than Higgs?Top birthday weekend 🔥 https://t.co/WnzjbOjvxz@AshBammy @EddieParnell @JackBaberz Cheers kidder!@cazjmay OMG so sorry hun!@cazjmay OMG hun congrats!!! So plzd for you can’t wait for the hen do! 💍 💑 💕 aaahhhh such exciting times 🙈🙈 xoMadrid vs PSG has been some cracking viewing, Asensio completely changed this game, class.Looking forward to the televised divorce more tbh.I didn’t think Jess and Dom could get more cringe than when they did a PA in a kebab shop. I was wrong. 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/Ra4vL2shyB@Official_BRFC need to look at renewing Byron Moore’s contract or champ clubs be sniffing around on that performance.Partington is a goal machine.The robotic apocalypse is imminent. Someone make these guys watch an ep of Black Mirror or any standard robots taking over the world movie ever ASAP. https://t.co/tAHnlEaAVF@iamfoxes @AdamMCraig Never forget.@blaiselucy Getting sick of your bullying. https://t.co/Mu1x8Y1RrPMany of us are still puzzled how Dennis Payter has a role talking for  Bristol Rovers fans. Terrible mistake for the goal granted, but Smith has looked a class above Slocombe for a while now. https://t.co/hIEBDKZSc1@mickeypcollins Will you be out this weekend so we can live like we're younger us again?@mickeypcollins I always thought you liked him 😩I'm 28 this weekend &amp; my facebook memories is full of whiny posts from younger me complaining about getting old when I was 22, 23, 24 etc. I hate younger me.@cazjmay Tough to say if it smelt worse or looked worse tbh.I’m not sure what would intimidate me more, being up against the fence with Yoel Romero punching me on being up against the fence with Yoel Romero kissing me. #ufc221Do do doo, we do indeed always win at Oxford.Hyped at this, only seeing good things. https://t.co/cdvmW3M2Tq@AdamMCraig @cazjmay @COLLEY77 @jbrain88 Taking us for granted somewhat, should we start auditioning for replacements?Oh God I’m so excited. https://t.co/uLGnR4tKlhScrap my last tweet 😂 https://t.co/krxXi3esCjPleased they’re rematching Dillashaw vs Cody, fight just interests me more than Dillashaw vs Mighty Mouse. Think Cody doesn’t start showboating and just gets the job done this time.Next tattoo booked for July 🤙🏻I tend to find the type of people who hate American Football also are the type of people who get hyped for shit like Darts. You're not in to sports mate, you're into pub games.And if it wasn’t too late, I’d be watching this. Tomorrow. https://t.co/U0y2GJK4IhI made up for no Vikings #SuperBowl by atleast making coin on my bets. On to next season, guarantee it’ll be Eagles vs Vikings in the season opener 😂😂 https://t.co/2CvrYdLX7EWhat a fucking game of football. Congrats to the Eagles. Really hope I get that feeling for the Vikings one day. #SuperBowlGronk Spike. https://t.co/NymgAdb5ksThe season of not having a f’n clue what a catch actually is. #SuperBowlStill got a lot of love for JT. Performance was good but not sure quite banged but the Prince spot was a touch of class for Minny #SuperBowlHeck of a play design #SuperBowlI’m not convinced that Brady couldn’t catch that, just wants Eagles to have a bigger lead for the comeback in the second #SuperBowlThankfully not watching on Sky or BBC so not heard 10 million: “Did you know Jay Ajayi is from London” takes #SuperBowlTerrible snap, holder almost saved it.Mountain Dew / Doritos advert winning this Super Bowl so far.Will of course be staying up for the Superbowl but there's no way I can get hyped for it with the Vikes being so close, yet so far. Can't even decide who I want to win, so bring on FA, the draft and next season!@DukeofNewport How the mighty have fallen.Might use the rest of this morning searching for old episodes of Dream Team now.
