@spmyrick Josh Rosen is light years better than Jackson tho.Thank you @Giants appreciate the incompetence.LFG ‚ù§Ô∏è. https://t.co/G1ajg41DCZLVE. https://t.co/zliBE20lij‚ù§Ô∏èüò¢ https://t.co/pfbc5Vb26wüòî. Bye 88. It has been a hell of a ride bud. https://t.co/ee3FyxB7e5@spmyrick I read this at first without seeing ‚Äúgames.‚Äù It changed the meaning moderately lol.Wow. https://t.co/6CeRzYFhqu@TheLanceTaylor @ClayTravis @jerrybearysong@ringer @jerrybearysong‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/fTXL9q3aC5What did I just watch??????? @LoyolaRamblers@alex_and_urr @Marcus_Mosher I‚Äôm not sure. I think they need to upgrade the WR corps. And just get younger on TE. Don‚Äôt even have to invest a premium pick or FA (lol).@alex_and_urr @Marcus_Mosher He blows. Gesicki from PSU is good. But he probably goes between 19 and 50.@alex_and_urr @Marcus_Mosher Not shocking. He‚Äôs been like this for awhile. Not a downfield threat. No legs. Good inline blocker. But yeah an upgrade is (has been) needed...especially when the 1 playmaker on offense is an RB lol.@alex_and_urr Dan was so awful at the end of last year lol. I‚Äôm sure it was just his healthy, but my god that Eagle game was miserable.@alex_and_urr Tru. They beat GB and LAR if 50 is healthy. It‚Äôs whatever. 2016 they got pretty lucky injury wise. Just gotta take advantage when you get those breaks. But they also need to be better when they lose 1 or 2 people. Like it shouldn‚Äôt cripple the season lmao.@alex_and_urr Yeah I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time. KC was a pretty good team. And they totally waxed them (much worse than the score looked). If 21 plays the whole year I think the season is a different story.@alex_and_urr 21 would help him a whole damn lot if he stays on the field. The game before he was officially suspended... the one against KC... they were an elite level football team. So they‚Äôre not that far off.@alex_and_urr Wow are interceptions now factored into accuracy?? Lol jk. Dude I like Dak. But you‚Äôre fooling yourself if u think what Dak did last year was close to good enough. He needs to improve. Year 1 Dak is a baller. I think he can do it, I‚Äôm just saying he was awful at times last year.@Eagles_Steelers @alex_and_urr @dallascowboys Yeah no doubt. All I was saying is the Eagles line is already great. But I don‚Äôt really feel like Bennett is a large collective upgrade of Curry. May help a little, may hurt a little compared to Curry. Just saying I don‚Äôt think this is like the move of the century or anything lol@alex_and_urr @dallascowboys Plus the Iggles D-line was already stacked. It‚Äôs not anything new. The Cowboys need better QB play (and WR play) if they want to sniff hanging with the Iggles. An overrated d-lineman ain‚Äôt gonna matter.@alex_and_urr @dallascowboys They lost Vinnie Curry. Curry&gt;Bennett. I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs on the Eagles lol. Def don‚Äôt want him on the Cowboys. They just need to draft well and not get suspended lmao.@alex_and_urr @dallascowboys Well I guess I‚Äôm just content with them doing nothing. Everyone they go after sucks. After years of going overly crazy in FA I think doing nothing is better than being dumb. I also think Michael Bennett is one of the most overrated players in the NFL so it‚Äôs just whatever for me.@alex_and_urr @dallascowboys Lol little salty bud?? I really don‚Äôt think the Eagles‚Äô move was that great. Bennett‚Äôs overrated and they lost Vinny Curry. But I feel your overall sentiment. Also yes... the shoe talk is lame.üêê https://t.co/VJz2USsfvo@PGATOUR @jerrybearysongüò≥ https://t.co/GHl1jwOZ3X@spmyrick ‚ÄúNot that dumb‚Äù lol. Debatable my friend.@spmyrick That was a joke. Just had to put that in writing due to the statement‚Äôs complete ridiculousness.@spmyrick Okay cool. That was really the only problem I had with what you said. He wouldn‚Äôt be top-50 on my list. Obviously the correct answer is Mark Sanchez.@spmyrick Well yeah it‚Äôs not my choice either. But I think taking a guy off your board because he loves the player is ridiculous. He‚Äôs made 3 pro-bowls in a row. He‚Äôs far from a scrub.@spmyrick There‚Äôs plenty of ‚Äúbad influences‚Äù on that list...Bell, Dez, Gronk, Mathieu, etc. All varying degrees of course. Incognito made a mistake. But the NFL has worse dudes than him. I can‚Äôt blame a prospect (perhaps an o-line prospect) for respecting his game.@spmyrick That‚Äôs different than taking a player off your board. And liking the player (not the guy) because he‚Äôs a pro-bowler and a damn good football player is a good reason for me.@spmyrick Well the poll wasn‚Äôt who is your favorite person in the NFL. Just because you like a player with a troubled past means you shouldn‚Äôt get drafted?@spmyrick Why? He‚Äôs a heck of a player.Seems like a great problem to have tbh. https://t.co/HR1xFMosmJWelp. Sucks to be a Cowboys fan.PHI should‚Äôve thrown w/ 2:03. Could‚Äôve won the game.That tweet did not age well. https://t.co/T2R7zOImmgBall game. New England wins. Down 5. 2 and change. Tom Brady. Give me New England.That was no more of a catch than Dez Bryant‚Äôs was.@alex_and_urr I‚Äôm rooting for a tie. I know a tie is impossible. But I‚Äôm still rooting for it.@alex_and_urr Yes sir. Screw the Iggles.Throw me in that little red dot in north Texas. https://t.co/3JwPbBsOrxThank you for not rubbing salt in the wound :) https://t.co/aO8yoNuBj1@alex_and_urr Oh and who you rooting for NE or PHI?@alex_and_urr Oh wait then the Patriots would win their 29th super bowl in the last 28 years https://t.co/ZWmMEjJFxZ@alex_and_urr Dodgers lost in the series tho... prelude to the eagles losing possibly... https://t.co/78n39DL2UIThe Eagles are a great football team. Awesome defense. Solid skill group on O. Great coaching. If Wentz was still in there this team might be unbeatable. And they still might win the chip. Pretty unreal.Eagles v. Patriots. Super Bowl. Great. Yay. Awesome. 2017-18 NFL Season can just go away.@alex_and_urr Indeed my man. Football just has not been nearly as kind to us. So much pain. One day it will be worth it haha.Must be nice to be psyched for an NFC championship game. Never experienced the feeling lol.@JShahhh But yeah it‚Äôs old haha.@JShahhh Probably won‚Äôt be the last time either. Brady is unreal.Welp. All my chips in the MIN basket. Go Vikes. #Skol lmaoEhhh...there were some pretty questionable calls out there. https://t.co/8VdjC82FwMPunt it to the 10. 3 draws you get the ball at the 50 w/ 1:30 to go. I don‚Äôt get that call.Why did they go for that??JAX should punt here.@alex_and_urr I was being sarcastic. But yes I‚Äôm hoping.Blake Bortles boutta become legendary right now.Jacksonville started playing not to lose. You‚Äôre doomed from there. Good news is Bortles is gonna have 3-4 min to go get a season saving TD.@alex_and_urr What a bunch of a-holes.Jk defense gonna have to do it haha.Time for the drive of your life Blake Bortles.Play of the year. Myles Jack. Baller.That is a fumble. 100%.@alex_and_urr There‚Äôs a reason they have 3 chips in the last 7 years lmao.The Cavs (other than LeBron) are flat out embarrassing.@nicksprake95 He gave Minnesota the ball w/ 25 seconds. The game is on the defense. All Williams had to do was tackle Diggs in-bounds and that‚Äôs the ball game. One of the worst plays I‚Äôve seen in my life. Unreal.@nicksprake95 He‚Äôs still a baller. They didn‚Äôt lose that game because of him lol.Ice in the veins. #DrewBreesüò≥ https://t.co/shtKLEDrJ1@alex_and_urr Yeah 3 years ago@alex_and_urr Indeed. It‚Äôs also fun to watch receivers actually make plays. Amazing what catching the ball can do to an offense üôÉ.@alex_and_urr Me too. Also can‚Äôt wait til we stop being stupid. I felt like I was watching the Cowboys on that last ATL sequence. So awful. So painful.@alex_and_urr Bud. Nothing is sweet. Our team is at home. I hate all these teams. Just bleh. But I feel you. Philly ain‚Äôt going anywhere.That ATL play calling was rough. Not one good play call in the goal to go situation.Eagles can make an NFC championship game w/ a backup QB. I hate my life.All the stupid reviews in the game and you don‚Äôt review that spot??????????????????üêê https://t.co/pYYsBQ3HV0Nick Saban. Before today‚Äôs game and after... the üêê.Why are the Falcons not going for 2?Retweet. https://t.co/ueQmY3GibBOU should go for this. Roll with what got you here.LOL. STRAIGHT AWESOMENESS. https://t.co/SZsRrwJdv0@alex_and_urr  https://t.co/EsPg0Fzq3PMark Richt the üêê.Qq https://t.co/YgjJFKuGiF90% Dak, 10% Dez. Absolutely awful throw, no need to elaborate. But Dez has to sit in the zone and even with that, 2 hands on the ball...$70m...you need to catch that bud. https://t.co/kqUfpNyFqtSeriously!?!? JG irritates me sometimes but come on. This game is on 4. Simple as that. He‚Äôs gotta be better if they want to get where they want to go. https://t.co/0XG2XYoyhMSometimes he makes me mad...but we don‚Äôt deserve this dude. Total stud. https://t.co/qMWzTNrMDzDraft SZN is upon us Dave. https://t.co/aKhk0kTiyQ@alex_and_urr @dallascowboys Next year is always our year bud. Forever. One day next year will turn into awesomeness. Wow that was a poem. Til then we hope...@alex_and_urr One day the @dallascowboys will reward us for our loyalty. #CowboysNationForever@alex_and_urr Yeah it‚Äôs rough. Easier to swallow than last year. Last year was gut wrenching. This year there was always hope, but it never seemed meant for something big like last year did all year long. But still not a fun day when the season is officially over. But looking forward to ‚Äò18.@alex_and_urr But I agree 1000% about the WR core rn. They‚Äôre old and slow (for NFL standards). Needs to be addressed in the Draft and FA. You‚Äôre absolutely correct.@alex_and_urr That‚Äôs the only way he‚Äôll be successful. He‚Äôs not Rodgers. He needs to be disciplined. He can‚Äôt make a lot of throws and needs to understand. He needs to maximize his value with his feet and make smart throws. He did last year. This year he tried to be Brady/Rodgers. He ain‚Äôt.@alex_and_urr He‚Äôs gotta be better man. There wasn‚Äôt a play in the game where I was like wow nice play Dak. He missed pretty much every throw. His two biggest plays were under thrown bogus PIs. He needs to go back to last year where he took care of the ball.At least it wasn‚Äôt painful. The team had enough to do it... just didn‚Äôt make the plays.LOL https://t.co/vOBAUzHqP4On that note. 90 and 95 need to be on this team come September. Skill players on O need youth. Weirdly enough the defense‚Äôs future looks much brighter than the offense‚Äôs. https://t.co/d6jFQ7k3hxThe D held Russell Wilson to 93 yards passing. Idk why they‚Äôre so hated on. The offense (Dak/Dez) crippled the season.It‚Äôs a 12-4 team. Coached by an 8-8 coach. Quarterbacked by a 4-12 QB. https://t.co/xjtkx4jybI@alex_and_urr Doubtful. Jerry thinks Dak is the answer. That‚Äôs all that matters. And for the foreseeable future (unless he goes back to playing disciplined like ‚Äò16) it‚Äôs gonna be substandard at QB.Wow. Just wow. This is gonna be an interesting offseason.Can we bring back 9?@alex_and_urr Well that‚Äôs 6/11 of the offense. Witten is serviceable. We have good blocking TEs. Obviously our WRs aren‚Äôt great but I feel that‚Äôs partially due to the QB. Williams, Beasley, Dez were all good players under Romo. Did they all suddenly deteriorate?@alex_and_urr He has the best o-line and RB in the NFL. That‚Äôs more than any other team out there.@alex_and_urr He‚Äôs had a bad year. Last year they had no film on him. I was never 100% on board. But this team is too talented. He threw away the season.@alex_and_urr I just don‚Äôt think he ever was. He was getting stats w/ Zeke there but he wasn‚Äôt playing high-level quarterback. He‚Äôs not good.@alex_and_urr Also true. But Prescott needs to change his game. He‚Äôs more one bad season away from QB being a major need. He‚Äôs been awful all year. Today his mental decision making was absolutely atrocious. His physical traits have always been below-average, but now it‚Äôs his mental decisions.@alex_and_urr Nope. 100% on Dak. Dez has been awful he made bad plays. But the game is on the QB. He‚Äôs terrible.@alex_and_urr They don‚Äôt. Dak Prescott sucks. He lost this game. It‚Äôs on him.I mean what the fuck. Ezekiel Elliott doesn‚Äôt touch the ball. What a fucking joke. At least we‚Äôll have 9 months to think about it.Season over. Dak Prescott‚Äôs job should not be secure for next season.Ezekiel Elliott is on the team, correct?Can we just all be in agreement Dak Prescott is not playing even average right now? He‚Äôs been horrible the last 6-7 games.Unreal. Dak/Dez single-handedly killing the season.SEAN M-EFFING LEE BABY!!!!! The defense has been absolutely outstanding so far.He‚Äôs getting protected fine. He holds the ball too long because he can‚Äôt throw deep. https://t.co/pEnjhHslVdDak Prescott and Dez Bryant have been -2/10 today. Rest of team championship level. Sucks.Why do we stop running the ball??????????????????????Your boy Dak just put us behind the 8-ball. WHY DO WE NOT GIVE IT TO 21 EVERY SINGLE PLAY!?!? Go after Kirk Cousins in free agency. https://t.co/pfkEBswI1GLol. Dak‚Äôs unnecessary risk taking finally bites is big. He has always taking way to big of risks for minimal gains. That time it bit. Shame.Great drive D. Now let‚Äôs feed 21.LFG. We‚Äôre obviously the better team. Just go show it.Not really. For some reason they see a need to throw to him. I don‚Äôt get it. https://t.co/O9OtwrhGAWThat might be the worst PI call I‚Äôve ever seen. (But still, this game (and the season) is on Dez Bryant. What an absolute joke.).Not really. We just keep running stupid plays and killing good drives. https://t.co/b4azMbAHnMWilber come on. This is the season. What are you doing?WHY DO WE STOP RUNNING THE FOOTBALL!?!?!?!?!?!?!?Tanner ‚ù§Ô∏ès Ezekiel Elliott.True. But what has killed every drive is not handing it off to 21. https://t.co/kRB1HV483pI will never understand why we stop handing it off to Ezekiel Elliott. Makes zero sense.Seriously. What a joke. https://t.co/zllIg34YhWGo Panthers next week. (ALSO TB FIRE YOUR COACH WHY DO YOU KICK A FG THERE!?!?!?)THANK YOU CINCINNATI BENGALS.@alex_and_urr LFG BENGALS, SAINTS AND BUCS!!!!!!Fuck üôÉ so close.COME. ON. BUCS.Come. On. Bucs. https://t.co/x46vuw93kbLFG BUCS!!!!!!!!!!!!@alex_and_urr IndeedIndeed. Sucks. https://t.co/EOsoQdE8XHLol he had it by a foot calm down. Bad spot. Would've been challenged and overturned if it was deemed short. https://t.co/ThVq2fHxYcChido sticked him. He got literally 0 YAC. Idk why people acting like Lynch did anything. https://t.co/Fez50wwVmj@alex_and_urr ‚ù§Ô∏èZEKE IS BACK. AND COME ON TAMPA!!!!!!JEFF HEATH FOR MOTHERFUCKING PRESIDENT HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!!!!!
