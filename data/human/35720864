@musemusemadamk https://t.co/r6oEpGpujl@thomasee When you think his legal team couldn't get worse, Rudy helps@MichelleMackey1 blind tasting is always the same though. In #MasterchefAu when it's pro vs contestant for a challenge, the pro makes something out there, the contestant, who is in a head space of a certain style/technique makes that.@UnderYourPorch Just a warm up for the #MasterchefAu return tonight then?@Rachel_Organa The defence of VAR was "it will stop the howler deciding the big games..."
There you go #aleaguegf@Rachel_Organa I'm speechless. Horrible game. And when VAR was actually needed, it went missing.How can you have a champion who came fourth? #aleaguegf #aleagueSo appropriate that in a dour season dominated by #var issues, we have a dour grand final decided by var issues.

Fix it. This isn't a win for football. #ALeagueGFAn #aleaguegf where the most decisive moment is the VAR, which has spent all season getting involved, deciding to ignore an offside goal. 

And where the commentators are trying to come up with every euphemism to say victory have been dirty. Embarassing.
#NEWvMVC@Steve_Dangle Or, from a Sharks fan view, two games from losing a series with a lead.

Give me this dream Steve. I need this.@punkrosette Why did we pull dell so soon@liverpoolfclou Nicely done@AndyMaherDFA When he kept saying "real Madrid will be loving this" I was thinking "our front three will love Madrid"Best ugly half of football ever. #lfc #ynwaTrent probably should have been penalised. But that just balances the Milner penalty from the first leg. 

#lfc@Jono5785 This is how I know I'm marrying the right person üëç@Jono5785 It's the morning after my wedding. I've already been told that it's expected that I'm watching the game!@didi593 How are the nerves?That was a good half. As I said all along, while no one had scored in Rome this year in the CL, they hadn't played us. 
Now's the time for the team to practice not switching off in games. #lfc #ROMLFC@Jono5785 Maybe the travelling kop was so loud he thought it was Anfield!@didi593 That's game@didi593 I'm not. The away goal settled me. Regardless of that thing bouncing in.A lot of "non delicious filler" in tonight's #sellinghousesaus - clearly they didn't have much work to film given Charlie only really has a driveway to work on, poor shaynna has a whole house to redo.#NewProfilePic #lfc https://t.co/TOfd7zG8uIShoutout to @JesseBlake for the subtle shoutout to the office. @AdamWylde @Steve_Dangle https://t.co/cnjKSmzTOS@forthejokes @andymcheyman I'm doing this right aren't I? https://t.co/eU1rMtiFxW@andymcheyman @thomasee Zip pay let me do 5 at once@forthejokes @andymcheyman Wedding is organised. Im golden. Plus, this is a gaming house@andymcheyman @forthejokes You've both convinced me. I'm downloading it on steam@forthejokes Stardew valley@forthejokes I've been pondering it@punkrosette He is forever teenage mutant ninja hertl@BecPobjie  https://t.co/ktlFpQFX10@BecPobjie Woohoooooooo@BecPobjie They look amazing@BecPobjie Ooooh@saskystewart And as for Nico, just horrible luck. Those Renaults are flying.@saskystewart When he gets frustrated, he throws the car into places it shouldn't be.@saskystewart Max is a danger to everyone on the track...Verstappen is dangerous. And not in a good way. I mean actually dangerous to other drivers. #f1 #F1Baku #AzerbaijanGP@Lin_Manuel Australia is :)Azerbaijan's anthem does sound like it's their perennial Eurovision entry. #F1@Gatty54 FIFA stopped Golden Goal in 2004. He can't seriously be using that as his defence? Also, i'd assume this will put a stop to his seeking a top job anywhere this off season.So wait, the De Marigny defence is "I thought it was golden goal?"
Come on. FIFA stopped using that in 2004. No way he get a coaching job now. #Aleague@MJPhotographer It makes the contemporary condition sound like the name of a weird Indi band.@LokiCW https://t.co/FTAbf2Xd0T@forthejokes Wait I'm fired? But I liked this job... Whatever it was. 

*Cleans out desk sadly*Can anyone explain why Milner's was a handball, but that wasn't? #LIVSTKI probably won't be watching the grand final in all honesty - will be too hard to do. #SYDvMVC #SydneyIsSkyBlue@Rachel_Organa that sounds more likely that brosque retires than plays...Still proud. Still thankful for all that Arnie has achieved with us. What a ride. #SydneyIsSkyBlueBiggest take away - JPM won't be landing a coaches job any time soon #SYDvMVCI'm going to have to cheer for Newcastle. 

That's going to be really hard to do. 
#SYDvMVC #SydneyIsSkyBlue@Rachel_Organa ThisIn all honesty, we've played badly, and we don't really deserve to win this. 
Having said that, I really want the equaliser. #SYDvMVC #SydneyIsSkyBlueThat was embarassing defending. We deserved that. Ninkovic hasn't been good tonight. #SYDvMVC@Rachel_Organa I can't believe that. He didn't need to play it either@Rachel_Organa Thankyou Terry!OWN GOAL!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEES #SYDNEYISSKYBLUE@Rachel_Organa ‚òπÔ∏è@Rachel_Organa I'm using Liverpool to distract me.@Rachel_Organa I just automatically cheer anyone against victory@Rachel_Organa I was worried we'd have a night like this@thomasee  https://t.co/HO4TGtR5e6@Carly_B Molly Meldrum has them on speed dialBahahahahahahahahahahaha.
Brexit supporters "We don't need the EU"
Also brexit supporters "Wait, you want us to pay a visa fee? Why?" https://t.co/1MoOktOawz@benpobjie  https://t.co/L0Q1GPcBWeThankyou all so much for an amazing night. What a band! What a tribute @stpaulpeterson #nothingcompares2prince #sydneyThankyou @tykanelson for sharing your brother with us. Tonight is magical. #nothingcompares2prince@GOODSAX Absolutely amazingThis is my manager #lfc #klopp https://t.co/Sm0wAm6FzqSadly no $100 tambourine this time like the last prince concert. But looking forward to @TheFdeluxe et Al rocking the Opera house! #nothingcompares2princeView https://t.co/BCIgRSw4AuWanted to order the chicken salad for dinner at this restaurant but I keep laughing. Why? Well, you know...
@HeyHeyItsConrad @PrichardShow@ItzStefD @Steve_Dangle Remember, we blew out the oilers last year, and look how that ended@Steve_Dangle As a sharks fan i knew this could be what game one was like, and yet, shellshocked.As a Sharks fan, I can't wait until this game starts...
I know what I said. We clearly haven't started playing yet. #SJSvsVGK #SJsharks https://t.co/o3eWP9AMj1Also stunned that Rosen hasn't gone yet. Don't know what's worse, Mora saying asking questions was a problem, or these GM's for believing it. #nfldraftThe fact that kiper feels Allen is amazing but doesn't like Mayfield tells you all you need to know. 
#nfldraft@MarcSesslerNFL @DanHanzus @ChrisWesseling @greggrosenthal great... Rosen, Chubb and Allen all there when Denver drafts. John waited. He got his man
#thisonesforjohn #thatonesforjohn #nfldraftMayfield is the right call. The NFL gets stuck in being a copycat league. The browns have tried that. Hasn't worked. Be an innovator. I'm a #49ers fan, but I like this pick for the browns. #nfldraftWatching the ESPN coverage but enjoying watching Connie Fox in the background entertaining the crowd. 
Sing some odds and ends if you need to @ColleenWolfeNFLTake this trump quote, and make the Michael he's talking about Michael Scott. 
It sounds like Donald really didn't understand the show #TheOffice https://t.co/lsVYejr0UA@paulfeig @mrchrisaddison Feels like Donald watched the office and didn't quite understand itI can hear @Steve_Dangle yelling JAKE right now. #TMLtalk@benpobjie Prince clearly.@Carly_B The ladder is fantastic.@Carly_B I meh'd hard at that. Now the new series of Murphy brown... I'm all in@MarcSesslerNFL @greggrosenthal @nflukhank Never have I wanted to read a mock draft as much as a sessler draft.

The Friedman school of economics will be falling to the second round I assume...Important thread. https://t.co/ApM1XoNoFE@saskystewart Hope you end up having an awesome night sasky!@andymcheyman @Audible_AU @audible_com It's why I did cancel mine. I was over it@AdamWylde @JesseBlake @Steve_Dangle his retirement lasted less than a year. Now he gets to go back to heavy breathing on air. https://t.co/QaXdXfjgNKStill my fave moment from this series #Sellinghousesaus https://t.co/sxp8fBmMXE@millionsofmyles got a prediction? https://t.co/KQDAjJT26G@andymcheyman "mum informed me the lead singer of 'ne ne wa' died today..."
Me "how will she react when the lead singer of wumbachumba dies?"@GusWorland @LFC @ChampionsLeague It's us Gus. You know we don't do things the easy way! Plus as Klopp said "win or draw and we are there. They need 3 goals and you know what happens when they have to give us space"
Great to score 5!It's often said we kill off teams with a 10min burst with goals.
A 10 minute burst with goals in Rome kills this tie off. 

Believe. We are Liverpool. 
#lfc #LIVROM@cmahoney21 And we will score in RomeWe are still very much in control. We WILL score in Rome. And we've just scored 5 in a CL semi final. Don't let 2 late goals take away from that. We've shown tonight that when we hit high gear, they can't live with us.  #LIVROM #lfcJust once, can we not collapse defensively after a great attacking performance. #lfc #LIVROMCan we get lovren off? His head is gone. #lfc #LIVROMDamn. An away goal. We need another one to give us some space. #lfcFrom Australia - @itzmartinaol is amazing and should open all public events, everywhere.Get voting Australia #matildas https://t.co/mHuDObMIFJI'm sure @karlstefanovic will be outraged they are doing this so close to Anzac Day. https://t.co/5TKGDQbwovCan't wait for Karl Stefanovic to go off at his own network about exploiting Anzac Day. 

Oh wait. https://t.co/sCfDaCRqio@Rachel_Organa @andymcheyman I'd like Canberra or Tasmania.@andymcheyman @Rachel_Organa The Twitter account thing is a fake. 
I think Wollongong or Canberra over places with too many teams already.@forthejokes what did you do to be trending... https://t.co/ub3hf9WHdK@Rachel_Organa @andymcheyman how do we feel about the Phoenix licence being shopped around? Especially southern expansion trying to buy it for next season.@Eloise_Praino Sadly yes.@andymcheyman https://t.co/zt0urMneJkSuper Danny ings! #lfcThat should be a goal. Which means it will be no goal #COLvsNSH@NBN_Australia Why should we be inconvenienced and have to wait until middle of next week for something we didn't do, and that wasn't fixed by the technician who spent less than five minutes there before telling people he'd fixed it??????@NBN_Australia My partner was working from home, and without reason her work day was destroyed. My already shortened week is now further wrecked. And I have zero confidence that a tech on Tuesday will care enough to fix it and will instead try to find other reasons that aren't you cut the line!
