@KosmishArtist_ @ZulaQi @ShaunKing @ocregister I blank out in stressful situations. I actually had a cop tell me they were surprised how calm I was after I was in a car accident. Maybe the clerk does too.@ellen_spins @stillwaters1029 @AdrianCJax Mmhmm but last I saw, that wasn't good enough for him. I quit reading any more replies after that.@stillwaters1029 @AdrianCJax @ellen_spins There was also a dude's tweets going around yesterday about how blueballs make men entitled to have sex because it hurts.
