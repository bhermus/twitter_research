Y'all don't know hot until you've lived in the IE for most of your life.Even if you feel like you've lost yourself, you're still there somewhere. Don't worry. Don't give up on yourself. Keep on searching.@estrada_corina I love you 😍As humans we can only see what we thing to be impossible, yet everything that's thought of as impossible is very much possible."A person will worship something... Therefore, it be hooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are worshiping we are becoming."Everyone is going to have an opinion on how you should live your life. The only voice you should listen to is the one that is God-breathed.I miss Disneyland so much. Someone please take me 😭Hope can make the difference between life and death. Prisoners of war who stop hoping are much less likely to survive.You're the higher power darkness cannot stand.Only by experiencing pain do we recognize the areas in our life that require healing.Fear was no match for Your love“Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.”
