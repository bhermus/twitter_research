You can have high picks galore (we‚Äôve all seen it) and it‚Äôs meaningless without consistent QB play.

You a seventh round pick is a project? That‚Äôs seems crazy to me.@CaptainBib @GTMAC21 @KevinBuffalo @Schopptalk They made the holes to get an elite QB!!! They traded Glenn, Watkins, Darby, Taylor, and Dareus to get draft Capital to get what ever QB they wanted. Darnold and Rosen were there... if they are the best on your board give the Giants whatever it takes.@GTMAC21 @CaptainBib @KevinBuffalo @Schopptalk Picked at seven and you want him to sit? That‚Äôs nuts. We could‚Äôve waited for Rudolph for that.@MatthewFairburn We are so screwed.@drew_pic201 This is his first draft. We don‚Äôt know anything about him. He sold a bunch of players for picks to get a QB. Fine. Then he picks a guy that has s many ? marks around him. Robert Mays of the Ringer says Tyrod is better. I hope Allen proves them wrong‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not holding my breath.@drew_pic201 It‚Äôs nonsense that Buddy Nix said. Kind of like the nonsense Brandon Beane said about trusting the process.@SalSports Honestly. Same ol same ol.

They sold 5 starters for picks. Get a darn elite QB.@Eldickiemon @RossTuckerNFL They are rebuilding a roster they dismantled to get a QB. That seems really counter productive to me.@RossTuckerNFL These dummies sold Dareus, Watkins, Darby, Ragland, Glenn, and Tyrod‚Äî&amp; passed on Maholmes and Watson‚Äîonly to dither about what to do now!?!? They should‚Äôve paid the price the Jets did or offer a boatload for the Giants‚Äô pick.@gordonbcooke Good news! https://t.co/D4eSglEwHq@JoeBuscaglia This is the kid who could walk into Foxboro and whip the Pats.
