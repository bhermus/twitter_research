Watching the intro to this golden knights game and I feel like I'm on acidYou would think they would've learned to appreciate the glory of the Oxford comma on the second go-around https://t.co/XeIcNeCUvrNobody more likely to jinx a team than Rovell.

Cc @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/kWP66vqAzk@zachary_e_m I actually can‚Äôt believe that trump hasn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt call him rafael during the primary. Also I haven‚Äôt seen you in 8 years, how the fuck are you? LolTed Cruz changed his name from Rafael to Ted and was born in Canada. He‚Äôs now taking shots at a guy who goes by a Spanish nickname for his actual name and grew up in El Paso. Also, this ad seems like it came out of a textbook on how to pander to Texas conservatives. https://t.co/OHDyx0DeoGIt blows my mind that Parise still gets booed at Prudential center. The Devils failed him, not the other way around. They chose Kovalchuk over him and that risk fucked them over when he bolted for Russia. https://t.co/2As99fCFtz@Buccigross Knight #bucciovertimechallenge@JimSaysHowdy @NRA I‚Äôm honored you use this opportunity for your first and only tweetHold a fucking vote, you‚Äôre not with anyone other than the @NRA right now. #GunReformNow #GunControlNow https://t.co/O9TfrcR28TIn New Jersey you have to be 21 to buy tobacco products. An 18-year-old legally purchased an AR-15 in Florida less than a year ago and used it to murder 17 people yesterday. #GunReformNow #GunControlNowWHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENEDHow does Fox cut to commercial with a guy looking dead on the field? Wtf happened?All aboard the Jags bandwagonI‚Äôm just going to move past the blatant racism of calling predominantly black nations shitholes, we all know he‚Äôs a racist and he‚Äôs not hiding it. I think what‚Äôs really insane is that he thinks anyone from a first world country wants anything to do with us while he‚Äôs president. https://t.co/WdYaBQpY2BBy the way, not sure if it‚Äôs been tweeted a thousand times or not, but this game being the battle of ridiculous kicker names is my favorite. Pappa Nasty and Blanket Shit for the win@Nick_Villmatic I thought about saying it‚Äôs still not as big because of the stage, but then I remembered Alan Bosley was being gracious to a black man at the height of the civil rights movement... think you winConsidering the stage, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anyone handle a benching with half the grace/class that Jalen Hurts has tonight. Absolute classSo much synergy from Disney right now. Black Panther + CFP final getting shitloads of love all thanks to KendrickYou do realize that if you present said award to the LOSERS you are, in fact, confirming that they are not fake news, correct? If you are trying to say that they are fake news, they would have to be the winners of the award, you unbelievable asshat. https://t.co/M2440DgIueSomebody should tell him what overcompensating means.

No way this dude concedes, he‚Äôs down by 20,000 votesThis Moore concession speech is going to be must-see TV if he ever actually concedesShout out to Alabama for doing the right thingThe intern who wrote Trump‚Äôs speech definitely included the word peninsula 63 times knowing full well that he couldn‚Äôt pronounce itThat play call by Kansas City to end the half... holy shitHang on, there‚Äôs no way that Jason Terry is still in the league, right? This dude playing on the Bucks right now just happens to have the same name?!!! https://t.co/qsrRn1N7eENico is on the board! Hopefully the first of many goals in a Devils uniform@brooklynsbeat Too late lolHoly SHIT, that Hayward injury was bad. Somehow horrific injuries in basketball are worse than football because you don‚Äôt expect to see themHey @KNVB - let‚Äôs start our own World Cup with hookers and blackjackNot making the world cup in concacaf is like... actually, there‚Äôs not really a better metaphor than that. Seriously, how the fuck do you not make the world cup in concacaf? Fire everyoneHey, quick question, did anybody else just hear Brady audible into a play called ‚ÄúOprah‚Äù?The Jets and Pats are both 2-2 and the Bills are in first place in the division after week 4... just like everybody predicted@realDonaldTrump Everybody hates you, nobody told him to do anything, you cretin.I find it hard to believe that Ireland hasn't come up with a better national airline name than Aer LingusTim Ream is fucking TRASH. USMNT might miss Russia in 2018 because of that injury to Brooks. BrutalChristian Pulisic is so fucking good#BrandNewScienceFiction was well worth the 8 years of waiting. I don't know what else to say... what a swan songBut how... he said he always needs to know the facts before he speaks? Nvm, we can't seriously hold him to something he said on Tuesday üëÄ https://t.co/yxankijL0sThe fact that it's even an argument to tear down monuments of men who tried to destroy the nation in which the monuments reside is laughableCheckmate, atheists - Tim the tool man has spoken. https://t.co/69o0Ug9feu"For every CEO willing to take a stand against nazis, I have several nazi sympathizers ready to take their place" https://t.co/1oHdRADVRLCLINT FUCKING DEMPSEYYou talked to the man who just hacked our election for an HOUR without an American interpreter present.

I'll start a gofundme, I bet America can match it to keep you from killing #netneutralityNet Neutrality is one issue that should have total bi-partisan support - the ONLY reason politicians are against it is greed. Period.Lost in the news cycle today: Ajit Pai and his erroneously titled "Restoring Internet Freedom" act have just killed our internet freedom.I had no idea that NBCSN hired Ryan Reynolds to do color commentary. I can't even enjoy this Oilers/Sharks game, all I hear is Deadpool.@brooklynsbeat Yeah I didn't know that, so now we're just talking insanity. I'd much rather get that pick when PG inevitably walks in a year or two lol@brooklynsbeat So we can draft a guy who will wind up in Europe in two years? Not every 2nd rounder is Draymond/Manu. You play to win + develop young guys.@brooklynsbeat Do those exist? We don't own our draft pick, losing only helps a division rival. Who the hell wants us to lose?@courtneykiara Never seen it but I'm pretty sure this is how A Beautiful Mind starts.

These violent delights have violent ends indeed@Nick_Villmatic that's not surprising - our music Venn diagram would be very interesting but this album's definitely not in the middle ü§ìIt's not even that Awaken, My Love! Is bad. It's just straight up weird. Boogieman, Zombies, Terrified - is this Gambino or Vincent Price?I wanted so badly to like the new Gambino... but holy shit this is terrible. I really hope the funk phase is temporaryBrook Lopez hitting a 3/4 shot nothing but net... this Nets team makes no fucking sense.

Keep spouting lies though üëçüèª https://t.co/BNSe2VgS86@Nick_Villmatic I love you too man, it's not easy having a civil discussion on twitter but we somehow pulled it off lol üòÇ@Nick_Villmatic the two hour lines in inner cities are always going to hurt turnouts there@Nick_Villmatic but I understand your point. Maybe the technology isn't quite there yet. All I'm saying is there has to be a better way@Nick_Villmatic so because hackers exist we should keep using paper ballots and counting with an abacus? No, we just need better encryptionIt would be so simple to just vote online with your social security number or something of the sort and everybody would do it.People are allowed to submit ballots by mail already, why in the year 2016 do we still have to go to a polling place?If we could for the president the same way that we vote for American Idol, voter turnout would never be an issue again.Voted earlier today, was in and out in five minutes. That being said, I live in a small town and I have off from work today@Nick_Villmatic holy shit he's getting +350 somewhere?
