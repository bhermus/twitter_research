One time when we were in high school, Sam came over for dinner and was drinking water out of a glass and just bit the glass at the dinner table. It shattered in his mouth and everyone at the table was in awe of him https://t.co/r8RzBgM2Iv@JSoupes Some flowers take a little longer to bloom, Jessica🙃@JSoupes there’s still time for our relationship to blossom https://t.co/BgCaVIIi6v@_annettevan I’m Old Greeeeeggggg@meghanoneill33 Oh so you’re the psycho - this is starting to all piece together@meghanoneill33 What psychos call it a shower shade?This may be biased, but the Miami Heat might be the ugliest team in the NBASomebody take this god damn tablet away from Kenny The Jet@glenjohnston52 This game is nuts!!!!This is going to take over my life https://t.co/evJH4GLg3c@gabe_yohannan This is an insult to Dexter.

Only thing that really has me messed up is Bound 2 over Late[Tries to go to bed early]

“I guess I’ll watch the end of the Sixers game first”

[Lays in bed staring at ceiling for 30 minutes]

“.......Cavs game it is!”@aitchpaul How much did that cost?@J_C_Chillin @barstoolsports Not even Barstool, just Portnoy@RealSway I’ve scoured the internet and can’t find the answer so I’m coming straight to you.....what beat did Tyler the Creator freestyle over in 2013, the vid with you wearing the Oakland hoodie@ngatt1 @mad_rog I’m about to go sell my vote on the page in your honorI’ll still say this: Rick Ross is the most underrated rap artists in terms of casual rap fans, and Rather You Than Me should win Rap Album of the Year 2017@datpeets I think The Office is a way better cast honestly. Combo of Michael, Jim, Kevin, Creed, Meredith, etc. is much funnier than Leslie, Ben, etc. although I will say Jean Ralphio is fantastic@egan_nick @NBAonTNT I’m way late but I know exactly the play you’re referring to and it’s crazy they didn’t call a foul. I mean we won but still lolLmao my dad just texted me “Dario’s barber is a dog groomer”
