I mean sometimes it’s good to put him in his place but I hate when people I personally know try to drag him 🙄Even though I didn’t agree with what Justin said yesterday about Kanye, I’m glad only stan Twitter was talking about it and not local Twitter lol I don’t want him getting dragged@jdbsmelanin why is this so trueI’m not one to EVER defend Justin but you really need to go back and reread his Instagram post. He DOESN’T agree with Kanye but still values their friendship!You guys are dumbAnyways sooner or later a guy will come into my life I need to stop dwelling on what could’ve been and move onI wouldn’t dare tweeting none of this on my mainI always go private when I’m in my feels lolI’m not one to be desperate af when it comes to talking to a guy but like idk why I continue trying 🙁I don’t know why I even bother like he’s not interested and I’m just making myself look like a fool trying to hit him up every single chance I getlmao well I’m so heartbroken now fuck thisI’m dramatic as can be but like I JUST WANT TO CRYAnd something else weird happened to me around Monday midnight but it’s too weird and tmi to share... but basically the point is WTF IS GOING ON WITH MY BODY ONCE AGAINMy right side has been hurting but the pain is tolerable, oh and also I can lift my leg up to my chest without a problem, so idk if it’s my appendix or wtfThis is really how my body is repaying me and I do not like it djdkjdjdhdk I do not deserve this, this is not fairI was literally talking to my sister about how some people I went to h.s with are literal druggies and theyre healthy as can be, but my little innocent 20 yr old ass is experiencing abnormal things going on with my body when I don’t do shitSo many weird things have been going on with my body I DO NOT DESERVE THISUgh she’s still into that bubble gum pop shit Ariana I really thought this album was going to be different 😭😭😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/L8ZdXpvFFCI still love JB don’t get me wrong, and he still gets me whipped af whenever he does something, but it’s just not as fun for me anymoreIdk if I grew out of the fan girl life but stan Twitter bores me now ☹️I miss when I use to be active on this TwitterOk but can you say where it’s from? https://t.co/ox4mwXSCDzI wonder if Justin is going to @madisonbeer’s concert tonight@Miss_U_Justin bittchhhhhh YOUR HIS MOTIVATION TO LIFE@Miss_U_Justin THE LAST PART@Miss_U_Justin “lol sure go ahead??”I haven’t felt pretty in forever :(ok I’m for real going to start taking care of myself, I’m tired of feeling ugly all the time lolBless your soul,  a real life angel https://t.co/Mw6DN0VJ8a@jdbsmelanin Sad because I never found the LA one 😩 I don’t think anyone didMy last tweets are specifically for Selena stans. I’ve seen a lot of “Selena is better than Ariana” like shut up.. if you don’t like the song that’s fine but bringing Selena into this is completely irrelevant don’t ya think??Each singer is different with their own sound, rhythm, beat, vocals etc remember thatI guess you only want to pull the “we should support ALL women and not put them against each other” when someone drags your favSome stans are being hypocrites af!! You claim to be all about “supporting women” but yet put Ariana against another female artist saying the other is better and what notWhat if she texted him asking him to be on the show👀 A BITCH WILL DIEJUSTIN???? as in Bieber???? @TheEllenShow spill sis! https://t.co/1x3NOt94YcHow did a upbeat song make y’all “hysterically cry” LOL https://t.co/wgLiWkA5fP@Miss_U_Justin but idk sis don’t trust me I never had a guy take me anywhere either lolol@Miss_U_Justin omggggg, just simply tell your mom your guy friend from school wants to hang out . Do you know where he’s taking you? if it’s somewhere chill to eat or whatever, she probably won’t assume it’s a date lolI won’t be surprised if Justin comes back to LA today🙃One of the most ugliest/scariest places in LA is Hollywood Blvd, Venice, and DTLAOne thing is for sure though, the movies make LA seem very differentI think it’s funny when people visit LA and tourists take pictures with everything, lol . I’ve been living here 20 years and it’s obviously just another city to me🤷🏻‍♀️Wouldn’t it be nice to teleportJustin sweetie why would you....Ugh punch me in the face !!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/G2Lep9NFfyWe still believe in love

I always wondered but wasn’t sure 😂Serious question y’all : is Cardi B black? I know she speaks Spanish and uses the N word a lot so I’m just confused....don’t attack me, it’s just a question....I hate feeling ugly ☹️I have been feeling so insecure holy shitThat’s the one thing that pisses me off the most . These models are not real. They all have nose, boobs, lip injections, etc, just to get to where they are and the fact girls compare themselves to wanting to look like them is horrible.Girls, stop comparing yourself to these plastic surgery models/influencers/celebrities!! Stop telling yourself “why can’t I look like them” they don’t even look like themselves, it’s all plastic surgery quit it!@PopCrave ok she was not pushed, she threw herself offJustin Bieber really went off in “Maria” 🗣🗣Jelena Stans are dumb af lmao I actually saw some of them believe that this picture is real. Don’t y’all see the line right through the middle? jdkdjdksk 💀 https://t.co/bzPmqKOSxAWhy can’t oomf realize I’m crushing on him lolI’m really going to start saving this last check was FAT and I can’t wait for my next one😛😛😛😛If Justin ever decides to tour again, I WILL buy pit MAKE MY WORDS https://t.co/wf9Y040WwqI’m kind of glad I didn’t go to Demi’s concert tonight I have decided I will save ALL my coins for #JB5people are really mad over this? hdjdkjd I think it’s funny! https://t.co/DZ1mXuuKdbI really wish I had friends who invited me places11:11💛He knows exactly how to get my attentionPretty sure she’s.... joking. https://t.co/0psIycipIlSorry when I’m in my feels I put my account privateI hate that about myselfI don’t know if it’s cause I’ve never been in an actual relationship before so I’m scared of commitment or what but idkI say I want to be in a relationship but as soon as a guy starts talking to me I already want to distance myself from him djkdkdjThank god I requested tickets before they sold outOk I lowkey had a feeling he was going because Jaden Smith is going but at the same time I had doubt shitI NEED TO GO TO THE CELEBRITY ALL STAR GAME EVEN THOUGH IT’S MY MOM’S BDAYYou’re kidding dhdjdjskwwwHhYyyyy is he eating her hand wwwhYYyyyy https://t.co/2Q6tim6wHWA relationship is no longer healthy if you try again for the third, fourth, fifth time...this is ridiculousBefore y’all come at people hating on Jelena re-evaluate yourself because you talk shit about Hailey, Sofia, etc you hypocrite LMAOhttps://t.co/Vh0msnSZSmYou want them when they don’t want you, soon as they do feelings changeBut I doubt Justin is with Selena there are no confirmation photos of himI’m actually on the freeway from Disneyland going home LMAOOOOYou bitches are weird when you still ship someone after they broke up. ex, Justin &amp; Hailey.
