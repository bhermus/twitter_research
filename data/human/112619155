Some good gear in place from Lie + Loft and last year's US Open @ErinHillsGolf  #golfishome https://t.co/CGLJhQsimx"In times of chaos many of us look for certainty. Experimental psychologists have shown our quest for certainty ebbs &amp; flows over time and for many is peaked in times of chaos.
So we the golfing industry, we are to blame.
We play on your insecurities &amp; your search for certainty." https://t.co/53ljNh03yW@dogrin Thanks David!!!  much appreciated.
