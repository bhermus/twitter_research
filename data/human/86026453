Sometimes the love we share with others isn't always mutual..but it's real.Pretty Little Angel Eyes.I do but I don't.I'm always pushing people away.Welps lol all I know is whisky gon be on my breath 😆Birthday weekend with no plans.I smell bad decisions in the air.Kind of miss the smell of cheap wine and cigarettes.I can do bad.
All by myself.I broke my own heart.I can't be caring the way I do for you. It ain't my place.I can't text you like I used to.. 
'Cause now..it ain't my place.The most beautifulest girl in this world, was always you.I will never tell another soul, what you told me.Is it serious...?
I'm just curious...Just a filler girl.You was once a priority..
Now you're just..there.It'd be easier if you just hated me.Good morning y'all!! Show some love and follow this lil cutie on IG!! ❤❤
