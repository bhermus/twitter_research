https://t.co/lZRaMu5VejI am strong, I am brave. Even though I am faced with life‚Äôs adversaries, I will face them with fierce, tenacity, and candor.I have a beautiful story to share, I am bruised by life yet I stand strong and wear these scars as a badge of honor. I know what‚Äôs important to me and I resonate and share these thoughts with the people around me.Some of these stories may be painful, some good, but surely our lives are a mix of both and yet it all depends on how we choose to create them and share them with the spectators in our lives. So whatever you‚Äôre going through right now, may I leave you with this daily affirmation:Death is a gift, at least if we see it in a positive light. It reminds us that our lives are limited and this very same fact humbles us. Since our lives are limited so as our story.Avicci, the famous Swedish musician, passed away at a young age.
