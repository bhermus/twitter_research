GreatHarry's hair though 😍Please could you follow me ❤️ #HomeTownSpree@HobbieStuart @brixtonbeachldn agh wish I could go 😩Idk Harry just makes me really happyIt never will be. On rant over it just really frustrates me how people think it's okay to say stuff like that.That just because they are a celebrity and you are not saying it face to face. That it makes it acceptable. Is is most definitely not andIt is not a way to get noticed it just makes them hate you. You would never talk to someone like that in every day life so why do you thinkIdk it just really gets to me. Because if you were a so called 'fan' of them why would you say anything that would hurt themNiall is so precious and its so sad that some people find it ok to say stuff like that to him. It is just so horrible #RespectNiall@RachStylesHemmo 👆👆👆👆👆Just feel like absolute crap all the time 😢@velvetgh0st @HobbieStuart @ArianaGrande omg this is amazing, literally gave me goosebumps@NiallOfficial's new shirts are so nice and for such good causes ❤️👍I need a holiday so much...Never mind I'll just watch Netflix and hope I forget how hungry I am #wishfulthinkingReally trying to lose weight but I really want food rn agh! 😩When Luke Hemmings won't follow you https://t.co/aHEjU5wAwvI can't get over Harry's hair, omg it's so different... But I love itLuke's voice gives me goosebumpsWhat to watch on Netflix 🤔Swear I spend most of my time taking clothes back to shops because I'm too lazy to try them on there in the first place 🙄I just don't understand why people are like that. Louis is still a person with feelings and does not deserve those comments #RespectLouisYou would not speak to people like that in general so why just because he's a celebrity would you think it's ok to say that #RespectLouisHarry is all over my timeline and I am not complaining at all@Ashton5SOS OMG YESS@cameronmonaghan looked so good yesterday 😍@RachStylesHemmo agh I'm so indecisiveI keep staring at the pictures of Harry over and over again, thinking that they magically will become clear@megsaystweet literally been doing the exact same 😂Please help me pick which Mac palette to getCan't believe Harry is going to be in a movie... Feel like a proud mumCan't deal with all these pics people are getting with @cameronmonaghan they are so cute!Think I'm just going to spend the rest of the night watching Gotham #soundslikeaplan #gothamLike two years ago I used to have loads of friends on here now I literally don't talk to anyone, that's really sad 😢@cameronmonaghan please come to England@cameronmonaghan wish I could be there 😢Okay so I'm going to be seeing Louis and possibly Niall in two weeks and I am not emotionally ready for this omgIt's so frustrating when the only thing holding you back is yourselfWish I could meet @cameronmonaghan 😢My #TeenChoice nominee for #ChoiceTVVillain is Jerome Valeska (@cameronmonaghan) from #Gotham
