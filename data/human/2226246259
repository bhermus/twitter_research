Patrick Lapinski quietly doing a good job of being a goal scoring option for the Doggies. 6 goals in 3 games, yet to register a behind.Good to see Nathan Freeman back playing footy. https://t.co/E3sbbyjvMD@davies_darrell @Adelaide_FC ü§û@davies_darrell @Adelaide_FC Boooooooooooo! You get outta here!To reduce the number of hamstring injuries, the new @Adelaide_FC recruiting policy is to only draft players without hamstrings. You can't hurt what you don't have. https://t.co/jZiiL2olpi#AFLtribunal https://t.co/kjwdlt5LW0@YakuzaNoContext https://t.co/5IfcYOQ1uJ@bosephnthejirks Definitely.Collingwood and Brisbane are smashing the "state of the game" arguments tonight.@SthAust That's debatable at this point.Initial reaction is to send Billings down to a rookie and upgrade English, but then I have the Luke Shuey problem to deal with too.@senzu_bean Sorry, I misread!@LekDogSC @PatchToTheMax Like all of a sudden Cripps is like "I'm dead in front of goals, 20 metres out, so I'm gonna kick a behind!" 
You put him up to this, didn't you, Patch?@senzu_bean Don't think they're peaking with so many injuries. We're being smart and finally testing our depth and letting guys get healthy.That one is going in the blooper reel.Looks like the good Gov turned up tonight!@dgusto81 We take our foot of the pedal for chunks of the gameHalf the team running on the spot that quarter. Workrate dropped to near 0 and they paid for it.@BigSledge32 Both seemed a bit lazy unfortunately. Grigg I thought in particular could have been a quality player.@neimadkp @SupercoachBible SANFL site is garbage compared to what it used to be. NEAFL one used to be good until SportsTG took them over too. VFL one is damn useless.@neimadkp @SupercoachBible Yep, got sent into the midfield today, doing OK. Looks like Poholke is sitting out as the emergency this week.Crows are definitely f'd in the ruck with Paul Hunter now hurting his ankle.@IMPACTWRESTLING with @WSWWrestlingAUS coming from Adelaide on Impact this week, here's a bit of @IMPACTWRESTLING that was supposed to happen in Adelaide years ago. Also @CyrusOverHuge is definitely over huge here. https://t.co/gzres79en9@SilvertonPark Dunno. Hasnt come back on, so assume not greatLooks like Reilly O‚ÄôBrien may have just done a shoulder. At least it‚Äôs not a hammy I guess.@iBuckzor Walsh was the only one who gave him a serious chance, once he passed he was sent back to the SANFL no matter how well he was playing.@SgtButane They kept hyping Panos as being a chance of being redrafted every year he's been at Norwood and it's never happened.Since potential mature age draftees are in vogue, decent effort from these 4 against Port tonight in the SANFL. https://t.co/nhYnf9rlDU@mysterycannon Team is going at 58%. Just a garbage game all around for them I think.@Ariotact81  https://t.co/VIfzOfTlkIhttps://t.co/UUUuepxEFJ@CrowsMembership @Adelaide_FC on someone using a 3 game membership to go to tomorrow's game, how do they work? Do they just need to scan their barcode at the gate to get in?@tim_michell Lachie Murphy out.@tim_michell Cole.@JonKellett Probably not with Betts and Gooch in the side.#LettersToGil #StateOfTheGame https://t.co/sWVWtlABSI@Adelaide_FC Will we be inviting the other previous indigenous players to the game?@MorasHorrors Ran 16km last week coming off 5 weeks back from heel surgery.@SC_Enthusiast @scottkdougan Murphy is good enough to play AFL, but he trained as a small forward across the PS, so won't be considered anywhere other than that role unfortunately.Was kind of hoping Dear would get a gig with Tex out, but Fog will at least still provide a contest in the forward 50.@scottkdougan Gonna be hard for him to get back if Gooch keeps playing. It was always down to one of 'em, Murphy got the head start cause Gallucci hurt his foot in the PS.Betts, Fog and Kelly for Knight, Poholke and Walker. https://t.co/Jl4OWmqeae@CyrusOverHuge @njpwworld @njpwglobal Good! It's just not the same without you!https://t.co/H1Rw5DmrOG#StateOfTheGame https://t.co/VpCuC86HIx@seriouslyben And Exum's jam too!Who even talks like that in real life? https://t.co/bnnsaQJjtcI like this. https://t.co/jGmglfeXjN@tatts37 It was awesome.Good day to wear my Utah Jazz shoes! #TakeNote https://t.co/c5QtFVx3Sa@Adrian_Poly He's a Bond villain. https://t.co/AJ9PPN9icsCompensation picks for poor performing teams is the worst. https://t.co/NNeMLlTKB5@Adrian_Poly But Doc is a "coach" too!

Special rules in the 4th quarter to really bring the excitement levels up. https://t.co/UQuMHhYRat#2
Play more vertically and kick it...
And again, constant player movement to avoid congestion. https://t.co/JYC8U7rPJ1Ideas to improve AFL football
#1 
Constant player movement to avoid congestion. https://t.co/0PbGfcOeZJ@Jeffreyhead No real issues there.And maybe one of those claw gizmos for Ben Jarman and Lachie Murphy so they can reach the top shelf without jumping up and down.All players have been issued hoverboards to use whenever they're required to go further than the distance between the couch and the fridge. https://t.co/etQQIV1xPjPrinting the West Lakes Journal https://t.co/8eQQfPQgx1Dew entered "old man territory" in record time for an AFL coach it seems. https://t.co/xJ8gfLLcMm@senzu_bean @dcarbs23 @tatts37 Gross.@senzu_bean @dcarbs23 @tatts37 I think that was due to Norwood taking over a big chunk of what was traditionally Port's recruiting zones in the SANFL.Likely going with a Greene for McLean swap this week and moving Murphy on for a rookie who will play. Luxury trades would be to move Billings and Jacobs on, but have to deal with doughnuts first.@LekDogSC @danza109 He wants in on the Simmons/Embiid bandwagon in a BIG way.@danza109 @LekDogSC LeBron is going to Philly.@LekDogSC You misspelt Lakers!@dcarbs23 @tatts37 He's playing for Sturt, we have them, Glenelg, North Adealide and Centrals in our metro recruiting zones. Port get Norwood, Westies, South and WWT.Didn't see that coming...

https://t.co/OMBepFhWZV@GavinPilkington @Adrian_Poly It's more about how ridiculous the rules are that a kid whose Dad played over 200 games and has been playing AFL since he was 5 can qualify for the academy just because he was born in Egypt.@Jonah_Rock Ben Wallace or Tyson Chandler?@ColefaceUF I get the "commerical break in progress" bit and then it plays Australian ads, but it just keeps playing the same ad for Audible again and again and again and again and again....The biggest problem now with NHL TV is it's playing nothing but a single Michael Bolton ad and I've now seen it ahout 25 times and I'm only 5 minutes into the 2nd period.@Adrian_Poly Similar thing happening for the Crows. https://t.co/6HQskBqDUSThis is when you go around kicking people like a kangaroo. Very scientific stuff. https://t.co/bKYtzQnuTzhttps://t.co/xRp4byred3@RyanBuckland7 I get some might not have a chance to watch every game, every week, but I swear it seems like some do nothing but watch the 5 minute highlight clips of each game.@RyanBuckland7 Whuh? The ball isn't kicked to contests anymore?@Adrian_Poly Wouldn't be surprised at all.@Adrian_Poly This is true, but may also depend if he thinks he's closer to a premiership with one offer than the other.@Adrian_Poly From all accounts Sloane isn't leaving for money, if the Crows match, send a Francis + pick back in return that frees up enough space? All guess work there.@Adrian_Poly why I have had pegged them going hard at Sloane in the off-season.@M_TownBallers Highest on the ground. Led the Swans in disposals, marks, tackles, hitouts and goals.@DanielCC03 Dunno, they don't provide those for state leagues.Big game for Darcy Cameron in the NEAFL on the weekend. 24 disposals, 11 marks, 9 tackles, 32 hitouts and 2 goals.Willie Brown rambling about mother's day, Raider nation, Raiders being the world team, Rrrrraaaaaiiiiiddeeeerrrssss, was probably my favourite thing from the NFL Draft.@LukeClifo @SgtSupercoach @StSupercoach @ReaCTxo @the_SC_bull @scsaviour @PatchToTheMax @LekDogSC @Cheezo_DRSC üëçCaptain Gawn and starting Fritsch might have been the only things to go right for me this week.Hang on, let me run the numbers on that.......Oh yea, just as I suspected, that's not good. https://t.co/il4T8CS2mn@crowii6 @bosephnthejirks They said it was "hamstring awareness" but we'll have to wait and see I guess.@crowii6 @bosephnthejirks Yep, forwad line seemed to stop functioning as well once Tex went down.@bosephnthejirks Wouldn't have thought we were 40 up the way some where carrying on.Got the job done, despite a few ugly patches. Impressed with Milera and Gooch tonight.@bosephnthejirks I don't think there's is giving much of a hoot at this stage to be honest.@TyHamilton24 Definitely.Good quarter for Milera too. Really active, nailed every kick to a teammate.Felt like should have had an extra 12 points on the scoreboard, but did well to mostly control that quarter.@Maso_78 He played.@THE_SC_GOAT @utahjazz Westbrook wasn't much better. 46 points from 43 shots, although again, they got hit hardest when Melo was on the court.@THE_SC_GOAT @utahjazz Wouldn‚Äôt expect so.@THE_SC_GOAT @utahjazz Home court advantage!Well done @utahjazz! Off to the 2nd round!@THE_SC_GOAT And again!Oh man, Thunders offensive rebounding then was awesome. Kept them in the game.@LukeClifo @SgtSupercoach @StSupercoach @ReaCTxo @the_SC_bull @scsaviour @PatchToTheMax @LekDogSC @Cheezo_DRSC I'm going Fritsch.@Glendog207 A lot of SANFL fans have make it quite known they don't want Crows fans at games and it's not the friendliest atmopshere, especially if you have kids with you.@ChrisJBrookes Probably not great as long as Gooch stays healthy and plays OK. Betts to come back too.@Mattyjenkos @SgtSupercoach I'd say Acres probably. Not sure if Taranto will keep up with Lids back in.@RedDevil723 Yea, it's a hard spot to fill with so many injuries. He's probably the best cause he could fill in up forward and let someone like Gooch or Poholke play midfield I guess. Hampton can't afford to take a week off with his stop/start injury history.@RedDevil723 Nope, didn't play.@RedDevil723 Supposed to be. Was named as an EMG this week.@BoredSaint @FantasyFreako @LekDogSC Depends if they've both played or not.@bosephnthejirks Yea, that wasn't all that good.@RobRobbie7477 Doesn't mean he's playing, Crows normally don't get Friday SANFL games, so normally the AFL side plays first. Gotta hold someone back just in case.@dgusto81 @LekDogSC @Wayno_Reynolds That means he likes you.Darcy Fogarty getting some midfield time in the SANFL tonight. Just trying to bulldoze through everyone, not working that well with Norwood having some more senior midfielders like Mitch Grigg and Matt Panos in there. Good learning experience for him though.@neimadkp Nah, I'd reckon Crouch will play unless he pings the hammy in the warm-up. Last two weeks people keep saying Pyke plays games at selection, haven't made any changes.No SANFL action for Lachie Murphy tonight, so must be sitting out for AFL emergency reasons.@Mattyjenkos I've got similar with Sicily out too. Just depends if you want to use a trade or not.@Mattyjenkos Prior to knowing how long he'll be out I'll keep him this week if I can avoid a doughnut.@jimmysquid Thinking the same.I remember when @Wayno_Reynolds said something like that to me once and he just ended up sending me a picture of a turd in the toilet. https://t.co/P8LHGywMzRMight manage to avoid a doughnut up FWD and use only 1 trade if Crowden and Fritsch play this week. Otherwise it'll be bye-bye to Toby Greene.@piesfan1497 Probably not super great ATM. Gooch trained in the same role all pre-season, plus Knight in now too as well as Betts likely to come back within the next fortnight.Damn, was hoping he'd finally get some AFL action. Got an elite leg on him. https://t.co/LN9N9sz4UN@RyanBuckland7 Had they been taking notes from Donald Trump before saying that?@Adrian_Poly They might get lucky and have him exercise his ETO. Though you‚Äôd have to hate playing on the team a whole lot to give up that amount of money since he ain‚Äôt getting $28 million as a free agent anymore.@bacon8100 Don‚Äôt think you can totally discount GC or Carlton and they might see it as a chance to get some run into both before the Showdown. I doubt they give either any time off once they‚Äôve been cleared to play.@MWL152 It‚Äôs an annoying thing that happens on Android now. Used to be you‚Äôd double tap space bar to do a full stop. Now it does a space and then a full stop.Sloane and M.Crouch potentially back this week means Poholke unlikely to play this week. Lachie Murphy available for selection, but you'd think Gallucci would keep his spot for now. https://t.co/TDnhMs5fLg@SC_Kev7 @jordo83 @JesseDCaldera @CRIPPStoniteSC @SCElites @LekDogSC @PatchToTheMax @ThePhantomSC @jock_reynolds @ClarkyHeraldSun @al_superfooty They'll be able to get the fancy ones too. Double coated, caramel, raspberry bad boys for the bigwigs in the AFL!Some nice big man tag team form in Richmond's VFL side this week. Callum Coleman-Jones with 3 goals up forward while Ivan Soldo gets 67 hitouts in the ruck. Mabior Chol does a run in for 2 goals and 7 hitouts of his own as well.@SC_Kev7 @jordo83 @JesseDCaldera @CRIPPStoniteSC @SCElites @LekDogSC @PatchToTheMax @ThePhantomSC @jock_reynolds @ClarkyHeraldSun @al_superfooty They're gonna have a hell of an office party to end the year the way they're doling out rough conduct fines this year.@Bacme16 @SilvertonPark Probably just annoyed cause he's partly wearing Lever getting such a big deal.The "Sicily Stomp" sounds like 1950's dance craze. https://t.co/B1wqi9ZdiIJames Sicily has finally made me understand what my mum meant when she would say "I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed".@HumanMeatball3 Call up the phone number they advertise on channel 78.@Jonesracing82 Perfect time for 'em!@Bonbeacher @PatchToTheMax @SC_Kev7 @al_superfooty @LekDogSC Yep, I reckon thats how it works if I remember correctly.@Bonbeacher @PatchToTheMax @SC_Kev7 @al_superfooty @LekDogSC I believe it only goes to the lower score if both play. If it's just one then their score is used.@HarsherFails 132 now, but that'll have to be finalized.@PouringJars About $40K, yep.Now 130.Danger up to 125 SCPoints. That's enough to loop if you've VC'd him.Kelly with the nice goal. Needed it, only on 64 SCPoints.You'd think in that situation Menzel would just go back, take a set shot and milk 30 seconds off the clock. Played on, missed and didn't give his teammates a chance to set up.@JoshuaKelly1977 @SC_Kev7 It's like the Candyman. You say it three times and you're in trouble.@JoshuaKelly1977 @SC_Kev7 Oh boy!@JoshuaKelly1977 @SC_Kev7 They have those 80's touring shows now where they put like 8 one hit wonders on the show to play their big hit.Parfitt looked classy in that passage then. Not a hint of panic while surrounded by players.@davies_darrell @al_superfooty Not something I want to do, but we'll see where we stand on Monday.@JonesStElite Golden oldies hour here on Channel 7!@Anth92Anthony Geelong defenders are doing well cutting off their entries before Port get a chance to set it up.@Anth92Anthony Old Walsh tactic I think. Guess the idea is if you don't mark it you can get it out of bounds and set up your defensive press to lock it in the forward half.
