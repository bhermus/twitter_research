Some interesting airline choices 🤔🤢🙈🙏@cardiff_blues @BBCScrumV @ERChallengeCup @TaffsWellRFC Enjoyed @BBCScrumV again tonight. Can't wait to get to Bilbao on Thursday. Well hosted @rossharries1. P.S i guess I'm a turncoat too I guess!? 😉@DragonTaxisNPT how much is a taxi Newport to Bristol Airport?@chowtaxis how much is a taxi Newport to Bristol Airport return?@CardiffRugbyWeb Great piece 👍🏼@CardiffCityFC good luck today from Cardiff Blues fan.@BristolAirport Thanks Joshua. Have a good day.@BristolAirport Hi Bristol Airport. We're travelling from the airport in June. One of our party requires mobility assistance to plane. We've booked it with the airline (BA), but is there anything I need to do with yourselves? Thanks.@thomascooksport Thanks Isabella. Really disappointed we've not received any itinerary or further details yet. Have a nice day.@thomascooksport flying on  Thursday to Bilbao. Only two working days between now and then. Still no itinerary....😥😥@CardiffRugbyWeb Unit@CathyLou206 Love the black peppercorn!!@CathyLou206 Not doing my street cred any good here, but love Molton Brown!!@rhysblumberg @Barrybados Lovely spot@Peter01471485 @cardiff_blues @CardiffBluesSC ...but flights are visible on departure board.@Peter01471485 @cardiff_blues @CardiffBluesSC Nope!@CardiffBluesSC https://t.co/oc0wBpQkbkThere's two flights loaded into Cardiff Airport departure board for 10th May. 0830 and 1250. Seeing as the 0830 flight is opetrated by a charter airline specialising in VIP transport, I'd assume this is being used for sponsors and staff? 1250 should be for the supporters trip...@CardiffBluesSC @cardiff_blues Still nada...@lewi0308 @WalesRugby How dare he try and secure his and family future eh?@WalesRugby Pathetic headline@cardbluesbruvas Verrrry good!@cardiff_blues  https://t.co/7uQ20V5aZc@ManuResidence @CardiffBluesSC @PipMarshall12 @cardiff_blues Nice glass!@IainMorris1 @cardbluesbruvas @theArmsPark @accrfc Can I ask where you got that made?@PollyJames Proper gent aswell.

Can you please advise?@PollyJames Look good to me.....Come on Scarlets fans, pack PYS!! https://t.co/FVMt1iGatr@British_Airways Thanks. Can the car seat go in the hold? Not clear from the website.@British_Airways Where do I find this when logging in? We've also requested mobility assistance for 1 passenger. When I check our itinerary it is allocated to a different passenger, yet when I check on the mobility area it's allocated to the correct person!@ospreys Awful@southwalesargus Not enough staff unfortunately.@British_Airways Hi BA. Spoken to CS earlier today regarding a minor booking amendment. I've not received the confirmation e-mail. Can you look into this for me please? I'm also flying with an infant (city flyer operated), can we take stroller and car seat FOC? Thanks@SouthTerracer @CardiffRugbyWeb Meyer?@Morgz4441 Without doubt!@thomascooksport Flight is now less than a week away.

Not quite the same vs BBC.@WalesRugby Great signing@SteveinSenni BMW@CardiffRugbyWeb Bit worrying how little possesion we're working with@CardiffRugbyWeb Would love to see him with Cardiff Blues. Good option at 8.@caerau10 Cardiff Blues have an allocation, mate.@BlaineScully1 @cardiff_blues @PRO14Official @ERChallengeCup See you in Bilbao.@suzie_wong8 @gethinjenkins1 @whitchurchrfcMJ legend@DickieCloggs @simonrug @TheNewInn7 Looking forward to the Merthyr game!@Aledbrew11 Deserve to be on Wales' summer tour. Always a welcome at CAP 😊👍🏼@DickieCloggs @RFCMerthyr @cardiff_blues Good luck Merthyr@simonrug Got ya!@simonrug I think it's Gloucester's already.

Hope to see u in Bilbao.@EllisJenkins_ happy birthday Ellis!@eMiLyLeWiS2387 @RickyHarries Don't right him off just yet 😊. I'm a big fan of Sam though so maybe a little biased!@eMiLyLeWiS2387 @RickyHarries A fit Warburton is something else though. A nice problem for Mulvihill to have...@cridlyn @DickieCloggs Yeah, I know. I'm sure it's good commercially wise, however, I find the experience and atmosphere disappointing. Maybe I'm just getting old...@Vanguff4 😟🙁@WaspsRugby @GuyThompson87 Good luck Guy. Great player.@RickyHarries And Nick!@RickyHarries 😍😍@HarriMillard_ No worries. Made a lovely break as soon as you came on. All the best 👍🏼👍🏼@HarriMillard_ great to see you come off the bench.

I think you'd suit the red of Wales!Well done @ospreys. I'd have taken @cardiff_blues qualifying for the Champions Cup and being in q European final. Actually, I would've thought you were a magic genie. 2 weeks to Bilbao!!No more judgement day please@JLyall93 @ScotRugbyBlog @watchingthesun @simonrug @Caradoc33 @AlanGreenwood_ Thought it was confirmed...@watchingthesun @simonrug @Caradoc33 @AlanGreenwood_ @ScotRugbyBlog Edinburgh@CardiffRugbyWeb Any other requests?@CardiffRugbyWeb Sending my thoughts and prayers to you from the middle tier.@lewi0308 I know Blues were hopeful too. Webb and Biggar big shirts to fill.We've hit Splott and still nothing #disappointed@lewi0308 Hope Ospreys don't pick up many knocks for their Euro play-off.@Allewis1985 @JiffyRugby @robindavey01 @cardiff_blues Fan even**@Allewis1985 @JiffyRugby @robindavey01 @cardiff_blues It's still a good team but not strongest available. As a CB Can, it isn't easy so I'm happy we've already qualified for top tier of Europe and in a final. Enjoy today.@lewi0308 Beast https://t.co/kx36oGVhec@Allewis1985 @JiffyRugby @robindavey01 @cardiff_blues Yes. Cardiff Blues have qualified for the Champions Cup and baring a massive defeat for Cheetahs, have no chance of reaching the playoffs. They're in a European final in 2 weeks. If a couple of key players picked up knocks, people would criticise that.Still no regional shirts of any colour!!@lewi0308 They were pretty big 😂😂👍@lewi0308 Don't have the depth in certain positions. Plus, Ospreys rested majority of squad last week. Think there's a lot of sore bodies after Pau last week.@BatstoneJC No offence intended.@Allewis1985 @JiffyRugby @robindavey01 @cardiff_blues A European title or a dead rubber fixture? We don't have huge depth and need players fit for Bilbao against a tough Gloucester outfit.@lewi0308 Not hopeful today with team we've put out. In two minds whether it's the right call resting players or not.@BatstoneJC Why not?Bus journey from Kingdom of Gwent / Cardiff Blues frontiers to Cardiff city centre. No regional colours yet. Next stop St Mellons....@BatstoneJC @WalesRugby @Nigelrefowens @IamAustinHealey speaks sense actually!@drdeanknight @Tj_Perenara @NZ_Falcons Legend@Princewillyhams Where's Shane?@MillardWill @BBCWales @LazerBeamTV Amazing!
