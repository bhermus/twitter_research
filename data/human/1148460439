Autism$peaks has done nothing but harm the autistic community with exploitive fear-mongering. They fund eugenic research. They promote child abuse. They actively silence self-advocates.

We know people have been harmed because they're telling us so. Rachel is telling us so. I can't just dismiss that. I can't excuse it. And I won't enable it.@severalmonsters @blknwite @RachelRMoran A lot of things that make people *feel* in control aren't healthy. (Check out the pro-ana community for one glaring example.)
If you care about people, you want them to be safe. Because you ARE accountable to them. Harm is harm. Don't just look the other way.@severalmonsters @blknwite @RachelRMoran One of the most difficult things in life is to confront your own powerlessness. But that's where true empowerment begins.@severalmonsters @blknwite @RachelRMoran If someone breaks my nose, and I insist that I'm fine...you would still call it abuse, because you know what it is to break someone's nose.
If prostituted women don't experience sexual trauma, no one does. Sorry, but I'm not comfortable with that precedent.@severalmonsters @blknwite @RachelRMoran I'm not in the industry either, but I've experienced abuses that I internalized and defended. Pain is always valid but human beings rationalize.
And recovery is a process. 
Please bear in mind that Rachel has had to process more trauma than you (or I) could possibly imagine.You can't separate "sex work" from sex trafficking, because the sex industry is innately coercive and innately dehumanizing.
People defend (and identify with) their abusers. (Been there.)
People rationalize all sorts of things.
But no one deserves a life of sexual trauma. NO ONE.@M_Kelter People are having a shit year. Ethics had to go to a farm upstate, a place full of sunlight, and fresh air, and green meadows where he can run free with other principles.

Comparisons to racism *are* effective in convincing some people, but it's not an apt analogy and comes across like envy: "No fair! How come THEY get all the tolerance!"@drvox Aaand that's what I get for commenting too soon!@drvox There's also a fair amount of projecting that goes on. (I've seen more than one person rant about others being "triggered.")

Easy to mistake one's own rationalizations for rationality, esp when one lacks the emotional intelligence to empathize with another's point of view.@brookewinters33 As someone who who avoids movie theaters (partly) because the noise from the audience makes it impossible for me to process the film, I have to wonder whether it's even possible to make something accessible to *everyone* with all our conflicting needs.@ShonaDav @MsJayTeeRattray What?! Fuuuuck that guy.@M_Kelter But...but...YOU'RE NOT A ROBOT. #Betrayal

You were outnumbered.
You didn't (perhaps couldn't) frame the discussion, yourself, and ultimately reinforced their framing. Difficult to stand your ground under those circumstances, but I appreciate the effort.üëâüèª #StopTheShock@_katherine_may_ @KiboProductions I'm not a mother or from the UK, but I want to sign the letter.

üëâüèª #StopTheShock@drvox Could be useful if you're on The Maury Povich Show.@mosaicofminds And if we're being honest, that's the *only* part of the story that makes this situation unique. Anyone who knows anything on the subject knows that abuse in these places is not an anomaly.

Okay, just cats.@hausvongore Love the hair!CAT! https://t.co/4ZuHrirJ2U@PhNyx @tclementsuk I don't think we actually disagree all that much. I don't believe in these divisions either. My problem isn't with non-autistics. It's with abusers. And that's even more visceral when people are targeted for being like me.@PhNyx @tclementsuk I think you have to acknowledge the differences and biases before you can address them. Autism is a construct. But that construct encompasses much of who I am. I'm not going to compartmentalize it, because that isn't healthy. So, yes, I accept it as part of my identity.@PhNyx @tclementsuk Cognitive bias isn't unique to any one person or group. The people who consider themselves the most "objective" are, more often then not, simply unaware of their own subjectivity. It's solipsistic. Self-awareness takes humility.@PhNyx @tclementsuk I don't think anything is as black and white as that. People abuse power, but power dynamics can be very complex and nuanced. The last thing I want is to emulate the people who have hurt me most. So it's not about tribalism. Or winning.
It's about empathy and mindfulness.@tclementsuk @PhNyx Almost no one identifies as a "postmodernist". Your sources have an ideological bias. Be mindful of that. You're not infallible. You're human, too.@tclementsuk @PhNyx Then I think you've misunderstood what the neurodiversity movement is actually about.@PhNyx @tclementsuk When I talk about autistic rights, I'm always very mindful of who is *most* abused, *most* dehumanized, *most* unheard. That's the point.@PhNyx @tclementsuk The assumption seems to be that the only way to support autistic people is to abuse us. Abuse is not support. People are entitled to respectful support and that begins with respecting our humanity and human diversity.@PhNyx @tclementsuk Diversity to exists whether you want it to or not. To say that disability is being "glossed over" is to fundamentally miss the point of what self-advocates are saying. All human beings have value. All human being are entitled to human rights. No exceptions. NO exceptions.@PhNyx @tclementsuk I don't think it ostracizes people at all. It merely asks them/you/me/everyone to have some intellectual humility and be mindful of one's own implicit bias and destructive acts. When someone says you've hurt them, that's information, not a judgment on the state of your soul.@ChrisStargazer @PhNyx @tclementsuk When I see what autistic children are subjected to, I'm glad I was an adult before I was diagnosed. It's profoundly objectifying.
When you see people only in terms of their gifts and/or their deficits, it's always harmful, because it's dehumanizing.@EVBritton @GMB Well said, Emma.#ActuallyAutistic and allies!

There is no autism without autistic people, so just listen to us and respectfully support us. Tell our families to do the same. After all, we're as sentient as they are.@PJMcGuirk85 @meltymarias @NeuroRebel Use that construct to understand and support people, not to ostracize them.@PJMcGuirk85 @meltymarias @NeuroRebel "There's a difference between calling somebody disordered &amp; saying somebody has a disorder." In other words, you're compartmentalizing. That defense mechanism isn't available to me, because I actually have to live in my skin. Autism is a construct.@fien_charlie But you are beautiful! I've always thought so. And I'm sure you were an adorable child. It's a shame people let their prejudices cloud what's in front of their eyes.@Paulwady @IgHawthorne I think you're both escalating right now. But that's to be expected when people are hurt and frustrated. *helpless shrug*
Let's not forget who is actually at fault here.@KiboProductions @amazonians That isn't better. It's actually worse. We're not extensions of our parents/carers; We're human beings with our own thoughts and minds. Would you try to gain insight into women by asking our husbands?
That statement bothers me far more than the neurology of an actress.@AuseklisTK Staining my clothes is my savant skill.How do you spill a strawberry on your shirt? I don't know, but I made it happen.@autismspeaks PLEASE be VERY cautious when it comes disclosing a child's photo/diagnosis online. There are a lot of exploitive and intolerant people out there.

I don't feel any need to distance myself from other #ActuallyAutistic people (and neither does the DSM, at this point).@hausvongore Serving Vulcan realness.@DSiupdate It makes me sad that this even needs to be said.
