1 Corinthians 13:7Kobe won an Oscar. Better than Jordan????1 Corinthians 13I joke too much for anyone to take me seriously@sydneyjennings9 Yeah I’m against the strategy but not because it’s “boring” but because more times than not it loses gamesBesides, how many times have teams used stall-ball and end up losing the game because of it? The good majority of the time from what I’ve seen.Oklahoma High school basketball does not need a shot clock. At the end of day, does stall-ball do anything to hurt the competitiveness of basketball games? I would argue that, If anything, it adds to it. It might be “boring”, but, it’s not about fan entertainment.Me: “Connor, look at my muscles”

Who could believe, who could believe?@somo_casanova @mbrower62 Yes, yes he is 😂Two years ago today, I did a study on if putting “TBH?” on insta selfies would get a person more likes than normal.  
My findings were,

If you are of the female gender, yes, and it is a reliable strategy to use for more likes. 

If you are of the Male gender, it’s hit or miss.Fortnite is a free game but I wonder how much money they have made from selling skins and battle passes.
