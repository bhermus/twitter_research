It's against everything we fight forYou want to support the same guy who is backed by Putin and the KKK? Ok have funüëãüèºY'all love trump bc he's a businessman but he's not even a good businessman.BAD HOMBRES OH MY GODIf men could get pregnant, there would be more abortion clinics than Starbucks and the morning after pill would come in flavors like BBQ.YOU THINK A WOMAN WANTS TO HAVE AN ABORTION AT NINE MONTHS WTF THE ONLY REASON THIS HAPPENS IS IF THE MOTHER IS GOING TO DIEIdk basically if you're against abortion, don't get an abortion. But don't take away a woman's right to chooseTrump is pro life unless they're refugees, on welfare, LGBTQ+... basically until they're born. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬ØBut I guess after sandy hook, we decided that children dying was acceptable as long as we can all own an AK-47.never understand why people are so against taking measures for gun control.

She take responsibility and works to move on. Trump makes offensive excuses.Only Syrians and Muslims are terrorists? Let's talk about almost every school shooting, church shootings.So problematic that people won't apply the word terrorism to acts of terror committed by white people@hcollins1221 you are amazingQUEEN https://t.co/EHhFSIYXM6HILLARY BROUGHT RECEIPTS TONIGHTI just told @nbcwashington who I think is winning. Cast your vote now! #Debates #NBC4DC https://t.co/1Ja2qSE5RjHillary's face after he said this brought me back from the deadThe Loop just burst into the loudest laughter at Trump's temperament comment.LEAVE BERNIE OUT OF THIS I SWEARTrump is relying on fear and ignorance for your vote. Study up, do your own research and make an informed decision.Tired of people erasing race and culture by saying we should be colorblind. We should recognize and embrace our differences without bias.Yeah Michelle's speech at the DNC was great, but what about her speech at the RNC? #neverforgetThe same people who jump to ban gay marriage and abortions are the same people who can't even think of starting a gun control conversation@_phoebemarie_ especially for big business, because trickle down definitely works.@_phoebemarie_ don't understand why people are against a $33 tax raise for debt free college? Some of your friends are uninformed ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬ØBy the way, $80 billion is about the cost of 8 months of the war in Iraq. üê∏‚òïÔ∏èDebt free college, 80 billion over 10 years. So 8 billion a year divided by 242 million tax payers is $33. $33 extra dollars a year.Not sure why he keeps bringing up the emails. There was a trial. no conviction. It's over. Should we talk about all of Trump's trials??When the moderator comes for you about tax returns üëãüèº #debatenightDonald Trump is so rude. This is the way he is treating a presidential candidate, imagine how he'll treat someone with no power?Hillary is KILLING it oh my god #debatenightHillary is so classy. If I was getting shouted at by a stupid pumpkin I would've flipped already #debatenightShe has him shook #debatenight"Trumped up". If you weren't voting for her already then what is stopping you now #debatenight
