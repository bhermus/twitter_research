@SqueakPaws @VoltAshkore I see even airplanes enjoy the Fursuit walk!@Phalanxfox @Erin_Kitsune Those 220v A/C units are pretty efficient if you can find them ^^@JetTheHusky1 I'd say 35-37 ^^@JetTheHusky1 But there are lots of twists, turns and Steep grades so they can't always achieve Track speed.@JetTheHusky1 60
50 ^^@TimusTheFox @TwinkyArts @moonblazewolf @ferricfox Oooof that Blue Harness goes well with your Beautiful fur!@malec_wolf I'm not sure honestly, maybe some Buddhist. My understanding of God or the Universe is so vast, It couldn't possibly be contained in a church.Also when you're out in nature and you realize it's just you, the sky, the clouds, trees, the birds, the sun and the dirt beneath your feet. There is a connection to the whole, that words can not begin to scratch the surface of. That is spirituality.Spirituality isn't some kind of belief or doctrine you have to follow.

Spirituality is discovering a space  within yourself that is deeper than thought. When you draw art, when inspiration comes and the art just seems to draw it's self, that is spirituality.Got this ADORABLE art from @Mikado_Otter !! 💖💖💖🐾🐾🐾 https://t.co/3c54jyAIUMOmg they're so precious! https://t.co/ed2FzCGjsNChoo choo!

Undies, 🐾🐾🐾's and Mild Things relating to Fursuits and Restraints... &gt;.&lt; 😶15. Not my thing, it's also not mine to Judge. If you like it, all the power to you! Washers and Tide pods are your friend.14. I first saw Sniper at Furpocalypse 2014, but we where too shy to talk.13. Only something I would rate as Mature, it's more spooky than anything. Send me a DM if you wanna see.12. Only Sniper, but I double Nose Boops as love kissies.11. I'm Gray Asexual, Homoromantic.10. Relatively. It really depends on the person and the situation. If it's somebody who seems closed minded, I'll keep my muzz quiet about it.9. RP is fun when its with someone i know who knows my interests, but also knows my boundaries.8. Yippp!! https://t.co/HF9VvgEJq97. Furnal Equinox! It's in a Very  Furry friendly and culturally diverse City, Toronto, Ontario. The staff there are super nice and Idk just Something about being in Canada for me feels like coming home every year.6. Probably 85%!5. Border Collie!4. It's kinda fuzzy but When I was younger, I had a dream I met this Fox, he was more of a Feral Fox figure, he was talking and I asked him what his name was, he said Valdor. Then somehow cut-scene to a bathroom mirror, I looked up and I saw his face looking back. Guess he was me3. Before the fandom, people still called me a Fox. I guess it Happened on it's own ^^2. I first saw the fandom in 2010, in the form of Emerson Collie. It was his suiting up video called "Becoming Emerson". After that, a friend of mine showed up in Fursuit at a railfan event, then it made sense that there was a group of people that does this.1. 7 years now!I can't be at every convention and that's ok. Everybody deserves a chance to shine.Let's give this a shot! https://t.co/0tcLojeWkj@shepbutt @BlueberryWuff @MadeFurYou Such a cutie!! Do I see Philips hue in those lamps? :OWhen I post threads to Twitter, it's not to strengthen my ego, but more of 'Will this help someone strengthen into their greatest version?'@Queen_Bongo Definitely a radiant smile! It was so nice to meet you back at MFF!@Chinchillazllla @CatofManyFaces @tombness DO IT@ericfisher It may just be my old thermometer ^^When it rains, take a shower in the bounty of the sky, splash in the puddles!  

When it's hot and the lakes dry up, have a ball and Play in the Mud! 

It doesn't matter what people think, make the best with what nature offers to us, have fun! Life's too short to be boring.@ericfisher Geeeeeeeez! The Worcester hills barely hit 80! lol@Kitchiki Such a precious Foxy(Monsters mentioned hypothetically, No harm intended on the Earth Creatures of this Fandom) Monsters can be good too!There will be times that we won't always recognize it, but there will come a time when you remember again that you can be an example of what you want to see in humanity. With hate, don't touch. Instead, see it for what it is and rise above. A 1000 Mile Journey Begins with 1 step.The mindset of "War Against" is a Collective of human dysfunction. The way we can help to not be drawn into it, is to recognize it for what it is: The Insanity of the human mind. Witnessing insanity is the rising of Sanity.In certain cases, you may have to protect yourself or someone from being harmed by another, but be careful of making it your mission to "Eradicate evil". Fighting unconsciousness will draw you into unconsciousness yourself.Mother Teresa was asked to attend an Anti-War March and said "I will not come". "But ask me to attend a Peace March and I will be the first to arrive"One example would be "This person treated me badly, I'm therefore going to get twice as mean to teach them a lesson". If we all try to "get even" with others, we're only going to perpetuate unconsciousness, because you're trying to be twice as bad as the other.I've probably said this before, but holy crap some people focus SO MUCH on what they don't want that they literally become the monster they are trying to slay. ➡#SelfieVSFurry https://t.co/YFltthb1Xk@BeagleInRed Huff@mango_husky Boston you say!? 👀@SneetyS Not best design, but I like the colour scheme! :P@SparklyRogue @CJFurFox *Blushes* thank you!@SniperWuff Handsome Woof! 💖💖💖😍😍😍🐾🐾🐾@Keven977 @SniperWuff **Wiggles**@ZigZaggyZagg Thank you so much! :3Just a comparison to Twitter's compression... https://t.co/24IUxRZGAL@xBladeWolfx This is really really cool!

These are relatively platonic snugs. 💖🐾 https://t.co/1PATNDsfSjCandle lit for My favourite City, Toronto, Ontario. https://t.co/RUXufhGq1xIf you can feel safe sitting with uncomfortable feelings of loneliness, and push through, i'd recommend you try it yourself and see how it works for you!Today: I woke up, made some breakfast, showered and relaxed. After 7 days i felt like i no longer Required my phone to complete myself. When i turned my phone back on, it was really nice to see my friends, but i no longer feel like i need to use my phone as much as i did before.The 6th day felt really good. I was awake at 4:30 am to help my folks with a pancake breakfast at a senior center with 100 people. I was running around a big kitchen in charge of baking all the oven goods, which would have been a bit stressful but i felt calm.The 5th day i woke up feeling light, i had gone to bed and fell asleep at 9pm. It's a feeling like i wasn't bound to ANYTHING. I lied in bed and listened to the birds outside my window and watched the sun move across the floor. It felt easier to be present.4th day was about the peak of the withdrawal and the turning point. Sniper came over, we had Fursuit snuggles, walked, cooked and watched a movie all without me reaching for my phone. Its such a habit to post about everything that's going on.3rd day i really felt like i needed to know how everyone was. My brain had gotten so hooked on always checking up, that it really made me see how unhealthy my relationship with social media was. It felt like i put more importance on others than myself.The second day i woke up, stretched, meditated for a few minutes and went out for a walk. My usual routine would be to reach for my phone when my eyes opened. I cleaned my kitchen, played the piano, meditated some more, cooked food that was good for me. I felt clearer.After the first day it showed me how much time i spend distracting my mind from the things that need to be faced. I do spend a lot of time focusing on positivity, but deep down there where still some shadows that needed some more light shined on them.Spending 7 days, 3 hours, 46 minutes, 54 seconds off of my Smart Phone has been an awakening experience. Foremost is the habit of checking on everyone, CONSTANTLY. It showed how much of a hook some people have on me. I had to rest and know that they would be ok without me...Friendship is love with understanding.Update! I'm doing good, haven't touched my phone in 20 years. It's been an awakening experience to put it in the mildest of terms. Will update with a thread on Monday. Love you Fuzzies! &lt;3@EvoShepsky @2MischiefMakers You forgot curl! :3@SSC_Costumes @Anthro_NE The water in most areas near Boston are around (+ - ) 2°C@thenicotinamide Go to the ice cream Emporium!@PolyphonicLemur The world needs more people like you!@Forgyx_Fox @WolvenWuff I think tilt likes to keep things old fashioned and simple.@TheCoffeeSnolf The Fandom did not turn me gay, it just showed me how bottled up my feelings where before i joined.Beginning now, I'm taking part in the 7 day challenge! 7 days without my phone. I'll be back next Monday!@NelsonOtter That's pretty close to me! You're lucky you have Northampton right next to you LOL@maxxthefoxx I hear you Maxx. I think it stems from a collective dysfunction that humanity is working through, because I see the same stuff in other fandoms I'm a part of. It's healthy to take breaks when It gets to be too much. It's important to take care of yourself too ^^@AzimuthAstra @2MischiefMakers @SnugsNotDrugs @MadeFurYou If it has an M, it fits! Gosh he's such a handsome Doggo! 😍🐾 thank you for these beautiful pictures!@sephyote Thank you for your kind words! I figure we could all use reminders now and then.@VuckoWolf1984 That's not a bad radio! Just make sure that you have the squelch value set to 2 or so, it's very sensitive, comparable to this one! Put a daimond rh77ca on it, and you have DynamiteHappy Sunday everyone! I hope that today you can find 10 seconds out of your day to take a couple of deep breaths.Scored a New Old stock RadioShack  Pro 135! Person sold it as is, "can't figure it out!"

I know when I go on a comfort food binge, it usually leaves me tired and feeling kinda blah. Definitely eating things that make your brain work better, makes you feel a bit more fulfilled I find.@finnowolf @Akiibaa Me!!! 😍 💖💖💖🐾🐾🐾@bluefops The bottom has some easily readable numbers on a barcode, I thought the numbers might be sensitive.@Jordan_Wolfy That would be a lot of fun!@Jordan_Wolfy It looks like a K5LA from what i could see ^^@RedLaurent Yup!
