This month I got a full sized liquid lipstick, a makeup brush, a full sized lip gel, an eye shadow, and a sample of a moisturizer!

I'm currently home alone singing and dancing to @HoodieAllen and I just feel GOOD@sadbandboys You tell 'em girl.

They're the worst.@BigDBoston why should it matter? if you like the music they make, their political views shouldn't matter@hannah_hermione I'm sending you mass amounts of love to make up for the unnecessary hate you've been receiving. You seem to be dealing with it all so wellüñ§üíúwow. A love. https://t.co/k6JRih6dSp@Sculpt_it_loud you go girl!I found a cute boy on tinder who likes waterparks. wowza. @waterparks please perform at our weddingI heard that people were booing @creepercultuk during their sets??

1. That is unbelievably rude. You should never do that to any support act or any act in general, you don't know how hard they worked to get there

2. I love Creeper with all my heart. Don't hurt them please üíúüñ§I feel for this boy. Someone give him a hug for me please. This is just ridiculous. If it were a man doing this to a women there would have been a whole hoo-rah about it https://t.co/Fqrex1eZ8q@awsten @littlviolences @waterparks WHEN YOU'RE BACK IN THE STATES COME TO MY SCHOOL AND I'LL TAKE YOU AS A CLIENT AND GIVE YOU A REAL NICE FACIAL AND GET YOUR SKIN BACK TO NORMALone of my.dream concerts would be @SaveFerris_1 and/or @BigDBoston on the beach somewhere in the Hamptons.

Idk if this is good or badüòÇ As long as I get insurance figured out I'll be getting that car though!!but I got into my first legit accident during the Nor-Easter this week. Luckily I was going slow and there were no other cars near me, but I lost control and spun across 2 lanes and into a fence. Me and my car are perfectly fine thoughüòä https://t.co/OVoxDof2B5so I'm buying myself a new car right and I've discovered that insurance is a RIP OFF. I've never crashed my car (bad enough to need insurance)  or anything but because I'm a newer driver they wanna charge me $600 A MONTH. WHAT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE PARX AGAIN THIS SUMMER@sadbandboys @waterparks @JawnRocha @underscoregeoff @awsten I got one at walmart for like $8 last summer!that also means that I get to see @waterparks twice this summer. I'm so excited to hug my boys againMe and my sister are going to warped tour at Jones Beach AND XFINITY Theater because @bfsrocks and @FIROfficial aren't going to Jones Beach. Oh, the things I do for the bands I loveI'd be overjoyed if @brianlogandales did a show on Long Island. Probably won't happen but we can all hope@ACTUALLYDOMINIC I honestly am only going for The Killers and BlackbearüòÇ But the whole tent camping at a music festival for 4 days seemed really fun to me@ACTUALLYDOMINIC I thought about Panorama but I'm not really into that type of music, and I'm already doing Firefly in June@ACTUALLYDOMINIC I'm gonna try to go to one of the dates in NJ! I already have tickets for Jones Beach and I'm pretty sure I'm going to Hartford@waterparks are y'all dropping Crave and Mad All The Time from setlists now that there's new music??I'm actually so sad. It looks like I'll never be seeing @Hedleyonline liveüò≠ They've been one of my all time favorite bands for YEARS now and they few times they've come to NY I haven't been able to make itüò≠üò≠üò≠I'm gonna cry https://t.co/irOLxlLoorcurrently craving Texas Roadhouse rollsHow many times is too many times to listen to the @SaveFerris_1 cover of Come On Eileen in a row? I'm sure I've surpassed it this morning.@sadbandboys happy birthday!just casually talking in a group chat with girls from all over the place about how much we love @creepercultuk , sending our pictures with the band, and how we are willing to "throw hands" towards anyone who is rude to them. This is why I love the internet sometimes@Itstaylerholder please no@EltonCastee if that wasn't my last week of school I'd so be down but I can't üò≠he's not wrong https://t.co/oNoakDJBgPI'm ready for another tattoo. I think I want an evil eye on my back... or my chest@KaceyMusgraves always puts out BOPS.
