Not had it again since...@FirstManchester There was no traffic.. it's half term.@FirstManchester why is the x84 SO unreliable again? It's not turned up in uppermill again. Which means I will have to get a 184 and then pay for a tram... again. So I'm not late for work... It's a waste of the ticket I get.@thedeadflowers git

Stanley Donwood was involved)
* Man Or Astro-Man? (Hur hur Uranus)
* Tomorrow We Sail (devestated good folk/post something/sea shanty genius)
* Come (yep)@stucow okay...

* Those Who Walk Away (crippling devestated beautiful plain crash)
* The Skull Defects (loudly)
* Chris Carter (his new album is fantastic)
* Cavern Of Anti-Matter (see above)@stucow @RolloTreadway not sure we did... I made a Sunday coast yesterday... That didn't use a tin opener@RolloTreadway @stucow I don’t think we have used the tin opener yet.. just incase you were wondering...@RolloTreadway @stucow I remember dad buying mum a n electric tin opener a few years back for her birthday....@RolloTreadway @stucow We bought a new tin opener the other day...@RolloTreadway @stucow However.

I'm crap at being sociable@AidanJohnMoffat The builders here are making a racket and I can’t find the bloody kettle. Pub, YES@MitziPenrice Yeah, if it went outside it would need something like that I guess… but if it’s small it could be useful for taking in and out depending on weather...@MitziPenrice Something for herbs@MitziPenrice Could be an interesting planter thing? (sorry… allotment on my mind)@nofansrecords It is you! Oh! Ha, I feel like I need to go as it’s down the road from me. But… agh...@saddleworthnews @nofansrecords Is that you playing this?piss crowns@NotRock @walkingheads Sure. I can help with some microdata/security stuff which could help with search rankings and that.@stucow Nope... They may explain why tummy is feeling a bit weird this morning@deb_blacky @LoJoSm see.. little darrencat agreement with me... well.. he would but he's asleep... and... a cat.. https://t.co/0HY9y6sa4N@deb_blacky @LoJoSm chess and onion ftw!@deb_blacky @LoJoSm .... weirdo@deb_blacky They can wrap them up with fancy vinegar types but it's still bloody salt and vinegar... Also @LoJoSm just sighed and took them away from me...Salt and vinegar crisps are the worst.

Couple of songs... Emma Ruth Rundle - Shadows Of My Name. Cat Power - Maybe Not. Elizabeth Ankara Vajagic - Where You Wonder. Soulsavers - By My Side. Messed up miserable horrible wonderful beautiful sounds...also.. still kicking myself for not going to need soulsavers when they played. buh.. lots of memories/regrets@stucow listen to more rachael'sHmm, I would love to hear some more Elizabeth Anna Vajagic, I just found a live video of her playing with Moya and co from 04 which reminded me of the @cstrecords roadshow... And that it was a long time ago...was years ago...  Hm...@shit_rock It would be interesting to see what happens for @GizehRecords manage to do with their pay what you want on back catalogue on bandcamp they have started doing.@RolloTreadway @wozzylovescats Oh, ah@RolloTreadway @wozzylovescats Simon?@wozzylovescats I could do with cuddles with my Louiscat, ebonycat and darrencat soon@y2penni :( blehcould do without all this snsezingHey @SearchWP we experienced the issue where a mass of swppurge requests took down a site over the weekend… any support in preventing it from happening again? Same thing as this old tweet...
https://t.co/96ThvyqbUa@stucow phew!@stucow who is this? who are you? what did you do with stu?RE: spotify... if there was a good music player for Mac I would not use it. iTunes is terrible... Spotify is terrible... The queue system is the worst... Winamp is/was wonderful. That's about it. Uhwell... the pub is nice and warm... which is rather nice... even if they are playing journey at super annoying volume (ie like in a shop... that annoying level where you know it's there but you can ignore)@mankyben @LoJoSm Is he fuck@Cornbury @IAmTimDowling @Alanis @UB40OFFICIAL @Squeezeofficial @deaconbluemusic @ZuccheroSugar @lissiemusic @Amy__Macdonald @mavisstaples @caroemerald @ninanesbitt @PixieLott @MarcCohn As much as I love you Tim.. that lineup makes me want to vomit... Except I'm.stuck on a train and I have no idea how I'm getting home.. so I'm not going to vomit.Also I do love Uppermill in the snow but not the transport hell and I'm glad I haven't planted anything bar onions and garlic in the allotment yet.Dydd gwyl dewi hapus pawb!@WildernessHymns Must... resist... record buying bingeWoah! That Skull Defekts album is insanely good!Aaaaaand https://t.co/9TurWHNJ1o 2018 is all live! Bit of a last minute ARGH but nothing major. Phew!okay

Got a bunch of other things to read@stucow hm… nah...okay... so how do i get nginx installed with ngx_http_lua_module and ngx_http_js_module at the same time… hmmm@deb_blacky :D@deb_blacky yesyestheyareabitlikethiswritingwithnospaces@deb_blacky iwantpeopletostopphoningmeaswellarghblerghstopemailingmeimgettingnowherewithanythingtoday@ChipPanFire Isn’t there always a queue at the post office?something something nginx@stucow meh

and cats
and stuff@stucow It’s not.. just juggling mess
No idea@stucow I want to go home also
:/@dizzyleen I am super jealous… are the cats sleeping also?@alterisian Ha, could work.. suspect it would be a pain to do though. All I wanted to do was convert something to a jpg…@alterisian I'm just loading up gimp right now... It's still trying to load fonts.... GrrrrOoooooh right..NOW I get hundred year old man @GizehRecords :)@Clarabelle12345 Whatsthat?@MalliSalli https://t.co/xM8gtfUGZz@stucow Sorry I sort of gave up. Been somewhat busy to say the least.It's.all.vibrating.and.very.very.very.loud@stucow @wozzylovescats *blocks you*@stucow hmm…. im not sure we can be friends...@stucow hm, you don’t like pineapple on your pizza do you?@stucow urm… Talk Talk or Hefner or any other band that I miss desperately.....a little bit of O))) this afternoon seems like a good idea@FirstManchester Too late. I'm on a 184. (Again) Please sort this out ASAP@FirstManchester But is it turning up? Or do I have to get a 184 and pay for a tram and be late for work?!Hey guess what @FirstManchester , the X84 from uppermill is late again! Is it going to actually turn up? Getting a bit of a joke this...@stucow lucky@ChipPanFire hm. probably not the best idea. hope not too sliced up.@FirstManchester Yep a 20 minute late bus is no use to me at all...@FirstManchester nope... Had together get a 184 as I'm going to be late for work now... Which means I have to pay for a tram ticket. Getting really annoying now.Hey @FirstManchester the X84 is late again, don't want to be late or have to pay for a tram on top of the bus ticket. Is it going to turn up in uppermill?? This happens pretty much every day.@stucow *cracks knuckles* where do I start....@RolloTreadway @stucow I adore that piece so so much. I'm really glad I was able to see it performed with Reich at the sound desk a few years back. Excellent choice!@stucow I can't think of much... Is it one of my classic favourites or what the world thinks is a classic favourite? I'm pretty sure me and the world don't agree...@FirstManchester No point really... Had to get a 184 then will have to get a tram so I'm not too late.@FirstManchester any idea where the x84 from uppermill to Manchester is? It's 15 mins late... Again... Which means I will be late for work...@stucow that’s the one!@stucow A-ha!@stucow Nadja - The Sun Always Shines On TV (actually most of that album) https://t.co/tiu2ym3G0K@stucow Yeah… you probably should learn how to slow dance to their pop classics like 'Raping A Slave’ and ‘Why Are We Alive?’@stucow Maybe, dunno…I like em a lot@stucow Current thinking is You Fucking People Make Me Sick by Swans, but I think people would not get the joke...@wozzylovescats @stucow @RolloTreadway It's funny you lot focused on the clown thing...@wozzylovescats @stucow @RolloTreadway They don't do the 'clown' thing any more. May recognise them from the eyeball heads?@stucow Bowie - Be My Wife@RolloTreadway @stucow @wozzylovescats It's Randy Chuck and Bob!@RolloTreadway @stucow @wozzylovescats ... he isn't a clown@stucow @RolloTreadway @wozzylovescats Ha! Hahaha! Go read about them. You will 'get' it one day... It's like The Cardiacs or Mr Bungle. You will thank me one day.@stucow @RolloTreadway @wozzylovescats Mr Poopy Whoopsy? Or The Tiger Lillies?@RolloTreadway @stucow I listened to loveless for the first time in ages yesterday. So good and simple. Fuck Shields with his fiddling.@stucow Hmm... All I remember then is dad's folk music... Something folky. That's all I can think of@stucow Swans are possibly the perfect band...@stucow Finally, interesting fact... It's a totally different song to the original studio version.... https://t.co/ltSih88VBk@stucow Also, as should be expected. Maximum Volume Yields Maximum Results.@stucow https://t.co/hO6aIh0pT4@stucow Pah... Your lateness made me miss this and I feel bad doing it a day late, but here goes. Swans - Blood Promise (the live version from Swans Are Dead). That riff should never ever ever stopHm, been waiting all day for @stucow to do his 30 day song challenge… hm...@stucow Hm, Vic Chestnut - Splendid… there are so many others I could choose from his last two albums. Hm. Or maybe Julee Cruise - Questions In A World Of Blue. Uhh.
