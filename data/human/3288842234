@schadjoe Exactly. Both games were shit and it seems to be a combo of everything.@chrisperk Welcome to bad Jay. After two weeks you can officially see his two sides.@ArmandoSalguero If they plan on playing like this they should just call it in and skip London.@OmarKelly I have officially turned of the game. I am having Philbin flashbacks and couldn't take it anymore.@schadjoe Apparently he is at Steelers practice facility.@flasportsbuzz Embarrassed to say the least@NFL @Jaguars @Yahoo  https://t.co/yXG8GoXWZB@OmarKelly please tell me this idiot, La Canfora, is just doing what he does as a gossip starting. He is the worst in the business! https://t.co/6LUpG0kiRe@jonfavs @OmarKelly I can't help but notice his remarks on athletes kneeling for the anthem run parallel with us flying fighter jets in NK airspace. Scary shit.@gunnerhal He is now currently holding Timmons roster spot. Once he comes back Rey is out. Surprised Marino doesn't hook him up with that Slimfast plan@chrisperk Well when Timmons comes back he can take Rey's spot.@SSMiamiDolphins Pay the man.@pfrumors If they were smart they would call Branden Albert.@NBCNightlyNews @OmarKelly Everyone looks to the sky for the end of days when it is already here on Earth. It just hasn't been launched yet.@ochocinco Your boy @OmarKelly  has a good system figured out. Can't remember what exactly.@ochocinco Pay per view cage match. I bet the entire world would stop and watch.@ArmandoSalguero He won't be around much longer@OmarKelly Rey is about to be of the damn team@OmarKelly He will be ball for TN.@ArmandoSalguero He will be back for TN, mark my words.@OmarKelly Luck run out?! After the last decade the universe owes us so much luck it should be in back order by now.@OmarKelly Both are home games.@OmarKelly  https://t.co/hzZYNsFR2s@BaldyNFL @Eghator26 It's all about trench warfare. Nobody just covers that so you definitely have a niche. I ball watch on Sundays but want to learn on Mondays!@OmarKelly I keep reading he's a MLB. Rookie year he played there and has 110+ tackles then they moved him to OLB and it all went down hill from there.@BaldyNFL @JayTrain23 @Dolphins Solid breakdowns. Just followed you because of this indepth analysis. Great job! Look forward to more Phins film cut ups.@ArmandoSalguero Shit two game suspension because we need him for TN and Delaney Walker.@schadjoe "See ball, get ball".@Sentinel_Sports @SSMiamiDolphins Why is Wake wearing a sports bra? Don't tell him i asked, lol.@OmarKelly Then he fell off after they moved him to the outside.@OmarKelly O definitely liking the Gulfstream. One thing I have been reading is Anthony had his best season during his rookie year which he played MLB.@MiamiDolphins @NdamukongSuh You say Suh-prise but I say Suh-port. Either way huge thanks to ask involved! The community needs everything it can get@IAmMissTLC @OmarKelly Years ago Prince did a random show at a bar after his show in Denver and nobody knew prior but everyone was mesmerized. Larger then life!@JamesWalkerNFL But. But. But with this guy. He apparently thought his playing days were past him if he did noting to stay ready for this year.@ArmandoSalguero I will welcome @lawrencetimmons  with open arms. As a father I can fully understand that anything can spike your shit regardless. Come back!@flasportsbuzz Everyone thinks Timmons is gone however i believe Gase leaves this on the team to decide.@ArmandoSalguero I am no pro but what a shitty pick up.@nikkihaley @POTUS After reading many of these responses its clear many remain delusional. You buy a house and put a fence up doesn't mean you hate ur neighbor@chrisperk Which means he will be back@EmptyAssets @ReynoldsWolf As Irma approached I thought the same thing. During Irma the birds (no as many as usual) were still flying (gliding) around my backyard.@gmfb I have shed 10,000 tears over the Dolphins the past decade. Thank you to Gase cause it's been a while since!@OmarKelly If Jet's blow up the coaching staff any chance we get Rodgers back? I think our current DL coach is holding that unit back!@OmarKelly Well you hear our coaches seem to be all about "See ball, get ball" at the LB level. Gase has the inside infi on him from Vitt.@NFLFilmStudy I am actually glad our week 1 game was postponed because i didn't like the match ups. And if we lost you know Miko would have trolled MIA.@MiamiDolphins @ProFootballTalk Two games tops. We need him for TN's Delany Walker not to mention they have a way better oline then LA which we had zero pressure on Rivers.@JeffDarlington Exactly. Something like two game suspension without pay.@OmarKelly He had one good year.@RobertRiol @JoeRoseShow Oh I did and if we escaped with a W in LA we should be able to beat the Jets and Saints. That is why I said two weeks so he'd be back for TN@JoeRoseShow It was over his family so valid to a point. Two game suspension without pay. Should not hurt us on the field either.@DeVanteParker11 @OmarKelly  https://t.co/bA4Rzc3gPK@weatherchannel #FloridaStrong https://t.co/HzBOs6iYFA@pfrumors Why? Funny shit is I remember peeps blowing his name up along with DGB etc. Exactly why the draft process (to us joes) is pure entertainment@ProFootballTalk Steve Ross cares!!@Caesar20417 @davehydesports I do appreciate a good, civil exchange as it expands my thought process.@Caesar20417 @davehydesports Well you know what Caesar you just made a very valid point.@Caesar20417 @davehydesports He is the best at what he does which is why this is shocking. Sales are sales regardless the product/services. This is sales and service.@Caesar20417 @davehydesports Same thing, right?@davehydesports If you can't keep track of your clients your spread too thin. This dude reps half the NFL. Maybe time to staff up.@davehydesports @steveshapiro  https://t.co/OwKIIzeMre@NFLFilmStudy Dude that made me laugh. That's good buddy.@OmarKelly Its that damn d line coach@NFL @RapSheet Jeff Ireland. Roster wrecker.@schadjoe  https://t.co/4feWm4FOyK@ochocinco With or without the kick to the chest?@ArmandoSalguero T-Baum and Grier dropped the ball on Zach Brown. Especially with what he took from Washington.@OmarKelly  https://t.co/q5HvPFoJqE@OmarKelly  https://t.co/zLeg7xzf4l@OmarKelly Which appears to be true since everyone is all giddy they can finally run uptempo/no huddle.@OmarKelly Marvin Lewis is better equiped to remedy that ego then lowly Joe Philbin.@schadjoe He typically fairs well against him in the past@MelvinIngram https://t.co/oPe2Gtu6Io@ProFootballTalk He is just mad because more Dolphins' fans so up for their home games then Chargers' fans.@thejackwang @OmarKelly Cute. https://t.co/66LwRoO1Bi@ddpheels @OmarKelly My buddy said the same thing. Also said that once they built up the offense the defense deteriorated. Said he never had both functioning.@ddpheels @OmarKelly Your right. I hope Tunsil holds up cause he lost position against Philly causing Cutler to fumble. Gase took the blame however.@OmarKelly My buddy is a long time Bears fan and said Cutler will straight up shred a D up and down the field then fumble the ball ata critical point.@SSMiamiDolphins Chargers advantage ST? They has their FG blocked that would have tied the game at the end losing the game for them. Edge: Dolphins!@OmarKelly Solid pick up so far. Glad we let Zach Brown go to Wash. Power was out but heard he had an awesome game.@Bokampers When are we getting a Bokampers in Wellington?@KSTiLLS Enjoy your forced BYE. NFL ALWAYS puts player safety first! Take the law firm of Parker, Stills, Landry and Grant out on the town.@Broncos @NFL Congrats VJ on your first win! We miss you in Miami!@ProFootballTalk  https://t.co/fYgpW6eSWd@NealDriscoll Papa Murphy. Minimal staff and retail overhead which increases profit margin. Allows competitive prices and ability to make a better product@comcastcares how do all my neighbors have cable back (comcast) and we still don't?!@insideFPL Power back as of an hour ago. Thank you!@OmarKelly https://t.co/UyjN9f41dL@insideFPL glad I am part of the 2400 still out. Bet the other 734, 000 are pumped. Ridiculous. https://t.co/ryboOK9mv4@weatherchannel Please take Irma already. Over 12 hours now and it's still ridiculous. I am thankful however that it was more wind then rain unlike Harvey.@insideFPL Funny cause i have talked to people in Boynton, Royal Palm and even Miami beach and they didn't lose power. Wellington out 13hrs now!!!@sammaddie29 All is well. Wind is still rough up here in Wellington. Been crazy for more then 12hrs now. Not bitching cause it could've been like TX. üîÑüôè@SNFonNBC That is very cool. I could use a distraction (and another cell battery, lol). https://t.co/RKCVQ2XeIF@insideFPL Can't wait to see you because we have been down since 8am here in Wellington. Stay safe!@Neville_Hewitt My backyard. Let's just get you back on the @MiamDolphins 53! https://t.co/jTA4IL7VaC#HurricaneIrma really popping now https://t.co/8IZjMNGYjt#HurricaneIrma picking up here in @Wellingtonflgov https://t.co/5Y5gNwauIR#HurrcaneIrma in @Wellingtonflgov https://t.co/OEFZ108cws@shomaristone @sammaddie29 Not even the money but the availability. I checked for flights on Monday and they were all sold out.@OmarKelly I just lost it up here@flasportsbuzz Ross is very classy. I am sure it means everything to all involved. Win it for Boss Ross!@OmarKelly Exodus or Phoenix@NFL @nflnetwork just set my DVR for @DanMarino "A Football Life" Friday at 9pm. @MiamiDolphins #PhinsUp@MiamiDolphins @schadjoe Classy.@JawuanJames70 @OmarKelly Glad you caught that. Mexico would agree too.@OmarKelly I am more afraid of my kids then the storm, lol.@OmarKelly Classy move by Ross flying everyone out plus their families.@davehydesports They did it for us!@ProFootballTalk Chiefs had like 15 penalties for over 150 yards. I am glad they slayed the dragon in foxboro but that was the worst i have ever seen NE play@SBNation @OmarKelly  https://t.co/DagroK9xyP@NFL @Kareemhunt7 Huge thank you from us @MiamiDolphins  fans down here in SFL!@OmarKelly And the Chiefs have had like 12-13 penalties for over 100 yards.@JarrettBell @OmarKelly Don Scarnacci is the reason Brady has 10 seconds to throw and any RB can run. The best OL coach in the history of the sport.@OmarKelly  https://t.co/WCtQ5d0eqm@Chiefs @NFL Please, on be half of all of us @MiamiDolphins  fans about to get smacked by #HurricaneIrma , go destroy the Patroits tonight!! PLEASE!!@nflnetwork @NFL @gmfb @nflcommish  https://t.co/sgKCmbaHHa@NdamukongSuh we may need a Watt like effort from our top guy after #IrmaHurricane. #SuhplyingFL #SuhplyingMiami@OmarKelly Make sure they are time dated. I used a video camera and linked my mobile device with google +@OmarKelly If your a home owner you need to take video and pictures of your home now. Insurance companies don't care about you or your belongings!!@TomGarfinkel Is that a metaphor for Saban's pro HC-ing career.@JeffDarlington More so of a grind with Miami having to play Saints in London.@ArmandoSalguero  https://t.co/5eIxtJdhxY@ochocinco  https://t.co/iAcZsXCalp@ArmandoSalguero The league is an embarrassment to all pro sports. Starts with Goodell and works it's way down.@DarrellAlst0n @schadjoe Ok now the drop off makes sense.@TheMarchingJay welcome to the #NewMiami. Phins Up!! https://t.co/eaKeRFLosC@schadjoe The fact that Drew stayed over going there means a lot in regards to the change in culture down here. #NewMiami@ArmandoSalguero NOOOOO!@flasportsbuzz NOOOOOOO!!@drewmorgan15 glad to hear you choose to stay in Miami bro! #NewMiami@realDonaldTrump I am pretty sure that the "Middle Kingdom" has the power to do as it sees fit in regards to North Korea and Asia in general.@schadjoe I keep reading he is not the same 49er version.@schadjoe Brendal, Reilly, Allen@NFLFilmStudy It doesn't appear Landry is not in their plays next year. BS. Betting the house on Parker becoming Green.@OmarKelly BB is licking his chops for Hewitt!@schadjoe He was all over the place making plays for defense and ST! He is this year's Pitts from Pit.@M_Darr @gunnerhal @MiamiDolphins You did a fantastic job! The business side to sports suck. Just know we enjoyed that boom of a leg and you will be employed by Tuesday.@NFL Tough divison as usual. Crap shoot who wins it. I am going D for Dawg just because that city and team need it. Underdogs deserve a bone now!@OmarKelly O you should check this movie out. https://t.co/ckE1i3v9NI@OmarKelly watch the movie Bushwick.@ProFootballTalk Oh it already happened.....Bullygate. Absolutely ridiculous media witch hunt.@OmarKelly Thankful for what he has done but he sucks at broadcasting. He needs to be replaced by JT next year. The AZ Card broadcaster is the FN BEST!@MarQueisG Ball out tonight! Tons of reps to show your talent!@OmarKelly His acting sucks, lol. Seriously that mattress commercial was/is horrible.@OmarKelly Davis, Steen. 8-10 weeks until Larsen's bicep is recovered.@OmarKelly Experience and they compliment easy other.@pfrumors If the @AZCardinals were smart they'd wait until Matt Darr is cut from the Dolphins. Dude is a stud just getting edged out by a lefty.@ochocinco Last time I checked you don't follow me or 90% of those following you. Just saying. You love us but don't care to hear from us, regularly.@SenSanders @OmarKelly Its cute people and politicians talk CC when we continue to bio-engineer our atmosphere regularly l like that shit is okay. LMFAO!!!@OmarKelly Not if Jamar Taylor made him expendable@OmarKelly I don't see the Suh recruit anywhere@OmarKelly Ross even made a comment during a preseason game about having to pay the unexpected 10 mil to get Cutler. He knows his finances.@flasportsbuzz Maxwell is a delayed starter. Takes him a minute to get it right but he will by week 3.@OmarKelly According to Ian Rappaturd Jamar Taylor is playing some serious ball for them this off season.@cheeze_89 @LRiddickESPN No I understand but I think that the cap needs a serious jump rather then the annual incremental amount.@OmarKelly If that is the case opposing teams can't stack the box in fear of the big play which should finally get our 3rd down woes resolved.@LRiddickESPN I would say it is more if QBs salaries go up then other positions suffer with this cap being where its at. Cap needs to go way up ASAP!@OmarKelly The Hound is a blunt dickhead that says the funniest shit at the best time and can back his it up.  Caliber role, great casting.@NFL Damn right. @MiamiDolphins https://t.co/LmJdIwruLN@schadjoe Definitely not Verner. Winston would pick on him all day long hour obvious reasons.@davehydesports  https://t.co/vdOtrWchvq@schadjoe Winston and TB would pick on him all day long.@OmarKelly It is especially since the Browns are hunting for a WR (very serious) and have the draft picks to make that move happen if they wanted to.@ClevelandBR call the @MiamiDolphins because we need LBs and have a bunch of WRs! Tannebaum is a trade enthusiast!! https://t.co/SeWsRTj0aw@OmarKelly His spot on the 53 is probably contingent on his commitment to losing weight and getting in football shape before cuts come or he is gone.@OmarKelly Probably still looking for his jock strap in Philly.@OmarKelly Must have been a bad one. PUP?@OmarKelly  https://t.co/h7vZTEkqtU@ArmandoSalguero Well we already know be is in Miami!@ArmandoSalguero And Bellicheat will pick him up using the space Kony created.@OmarKelly They only need Bellichek.@OmarKelly BA would make so much sense.@NFLFilmStudy I hear you. What are your thoughts on Davis? Catching some good buzz.@NFLFilmStudy Practice. Fasano will be greeting all those during the season.@OmarKelly I was in an inter racial relationship and visited her family in ATL and Houston. Racist come in all shapes and have been bold forever!@ArmandoSalguero  https://t.co/Lp24WlY361@89SteveSmith @NFL JT all day.@antwanstaley @SpikeLee Hey @spikelee we all get your point buy don't reach for relevance. Ross is the last person to even come close to including in your BS!@antwanstaley @SpikeLee is looking for relevance. He thinks he found himself a lightning rod to charge from. Truth is @MiamiDolphins are the last to f w/.@OmarKelly This guy is a must add. When he gave interviews you could tell how "team first" this guy is. I really hope they at least make an effort 4 BA@gunnerhal  https://t.co/m6XPpPeQOL@OmarKelly Crazy they don't reach out to Albert. Great guy and he knows the system and still plays at a high level. He also seemed to like it here.@OmarKelly It is the D-Line coach! Kacy Rodgers would have these guys top 3 easily.@OmarKelly Mark Sanchez. Sam Bradford? I will say i think there are more that hate Brady then like him. Respecting of course is way different.@Brianpeckin @OmarKelly Stupid followed up with moron. So burnt. You may want to go back and recheck your facts. I'll use whole #s 4u. 3√ó200=600yds, 600√∑12=50yds.üëåüê¥@WhiteHouse Since 2006. WTF? Whoever is in charge of this account should just stop and think about the tweets before hitting that little blue button.@bigj9797 It is time to flip that switch homie because jobs in the real world suck supreme ass. Crush that dream as long as you can!! #NewMiami@OmarKelly If I had Instagram I'd follow you but I need to fight the power half the time, lol.@OmarKelly @KSTiLLS I know O you don't like players being tagged in your shit bit this is worth it to me to put this out to the universe.@OmarKelly @KSTiLLS  we need more more Carr/Mack type stuff. Kids of all ages and  backgrounds see that and are not confused about the message sent!@OmarKelly You don't think he'd get poached?@OmarKelly Storm and Perry will duke it out. I  cool with either.@OmarKelly Since M.Williams failed last year and J.Phillips currently failing do you think T-Baum will quit taking chances on players w/ motor concerns@OmarKelly  https://t.co/7K3WqqC3Ok@OmarKelly I am still not buying into the J-Train hype. He couldn't break 100 yards per game without the unicorns last year. He is good not great.@OmarKelly  https://t.co/CrDJvMIJNx@KSTiLLS @gunnerhal I believe the Carr/Mack and Long/Jenkins approach sends a clearer message that we don't need the gov't to come together as 1 nation 1 race.@davehydesports The combo of those large crossbows (dragon glass spears) that liquid fire from a few seasons back, forged dragon glass weapons and dragons.
