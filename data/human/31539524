#devastated https://t.co/OYULUtsHIzOne step closer. Anxiety levels are through the roof. Holy moly! https://t.co/Cuo5ScIjiL@thetarotlady It triggers others 😂@thetarotlady All depends on one phone call. Hoping it’s good news. Yes I’m being a vague Scorpio 😝I know the universe has my back, but I really want to claim this one thing. Therefore I’m conflicted. https://t.co/XCL8LDC8D4@daniellefishel #TeamPizzaLovers@BellaLeslie I work in the Lumber &amp; Building Material industry. You’d be surprised at how many talented carpenters/builders/masons/etc do t have a website. It’s a generational thing for them. 

Otherwise I agree.My heels have been killing my feet all day. Come to find out they have been systematically ripping off my flesh. Still very much in pain...

All in the name of “Fashion”. 🙄 https://t.co/qbKUyDuaEH@tarotbyhilary It’s essential.

SMH. https://t.co/EKXpewyiVX@YESNetwork need to find a way to let cable cutters watch the game. I’m willing to pay a subscription. I do NOT cable.@thetarotlady Think we will need a support group after this one.@thetarotlady T I’m dying. Make the planets stop.When will this madness end? https://t.co/hx5WF0D5kz@thetarotlady Long days are all I have. Yet the year is always so short.

Get them ALL the time.It is absolutely insane the amount of stuff you accumulate in 10 years of marriage. Like, how in the hell did we make room for all of this? 

#packingishard https://t.co/2RP0T4JvM3For the first time in over 14+ years my husband did not have to go outside and battle the snow. https://t.co/8DJhg6D4Ru🎵 Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow! 🎶 https://t.co/RG8ElM5EGfSo incredibly tired!@nwg83 Might b crazy enough to work.@thetarotlady One of my fave cards.@TheLazzrich Or the Others for the less hell bent.@TheLazzrich Those are my fave kinda mornings.@DarkLaiX You got this kiddo@thetarotlady I’m hid in a bubble as soon as I saw that card. No joke.@thetarotlady Whyyyyyyyy though. Whyyyyyy.@jedip13 My local Alamo Drafthouse is donating towards the Boys and Girls Club with every Black Panther ticket purchase. ❤️@TheLazzrich Finished Birth by Sleep. Gonna jump into the first Kingdom Hearts this week. I’m going through all the games before the third one comes out.That smile at the end 😍 https://t.co/2V199EkCaR@BellaLeslie lol awww@ChrisMelMal1 Did you know Korea used TECHNOLOGY for the #OpeningCeremony? Because they did. Loads of them. Lots and lots. 

Seriously wish I took count of how many times they said TECHNOLOGY.@ChrisMelMal1 It was the biggest buzzkill and over explanation I have ever witnessed.@BellaLeslie It’s definitely mixed feelings. The original will always hold a special place in my heart. But I am intrigued with the renewed vision. Just hope it’s done right and not hastily put together for $$$@AntonioParis Thank goodness for ☕️@BellaLeslie They are. I have fixed feelings about that.@DarkLaiX How are classes?@jedip13 😂😂And at double the price of regular Doritos too. 

Is this for real? https://t.co/A6rfs0A9QV@Johanne_4 It has lol@BellaLeslie They were all pissed that she had something in her mouth before singing (it was a throat lozenge cuz she had the flu). 

I enjoy JT, but felt cheated by the performance.  He did snippets of all his hits. Good performance overall, just left me wanting more.@BellaLeslie I’d save the money until it’s out for rent. Acting was good, the set design was crazy good, the plot was too weak for the historic nature of the house and of Sarah Winchester. 

I judge it harshly cuz I’m a huge fan of the house and want to go one day. #winchester@BellaLeslie Nope and good question. Not sure if we are 😱

So the verdict is: You’re Psychic! https://t.co/FLU9QXcX9u@BellaLeslie Saw the movie but I didn’t tweet about it. I did FB it tho.#kingdomhearts marathon today. #gamergirl #gamer https://t.co/z5pS2F9Usj@kscutiepie Oh Carla. My heart breaks for you and your family. I know no words can help make you feel better. Just know that I’m thinking of you and your family today. https://t.co/vlzE09WDwy@jedip13 Jellies, we were at 25 brrrrr 🌬😬@jedip13 The bit that I saw, his wife didn’t even walk in or even RIDE in with him. 

Mind you sawit on accident. I did not want to see that mess speak.Couldn’t sleep last night. I can FEEL it in my face how much I couldn’t sleep last night. Ok make-up, Work your magic today! https://t.co/STrEkg8x3K@Soren_Ltd Love it!@jedip13 MSNBC is now labeled as fake news.@TheLazzrich Logic escapes some ppl@TheLazzrich @hiddnen @ARisenPh0enix lol 😁 love it lol@DarkLaiX lol@TheLazzrich @hiddnen @ARisenPh0enix I don’t get a thank you dance 😔@BellaLeslie I’m sorry that’s slightly funny.@TheLazzrich lol you can do it!@ThatBuddha Oh no!!Sunday’s have become synonymous with Laundry Day. Oh well. Let’s get cracking folks! https://t.co/06QIv7D9IX🤦🏽‍♀️ https://t.co/5z9HfV6nuB@thetarotlady Laundry and work. How about you?@jedip13 Shuffle itThey should also be held accountable for keeping things under cover and silencing the victims. https://t.co/8NCZ3UEGO3
