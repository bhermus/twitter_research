@FJB19 If I was Ric I would stay at Red Bull. I think there on the up. The other 2 teams are to scared to make a decision. Mercedes are terrible on strategy. Ham had time to pit, but like Wolf said. We had talked about it before the race. There is no reacting to race events. Useless@CroftyF1 It’s great to here the Ferrari mechanic is on the mend. Is just me, who thinks Kimi should have gone over to the mechanic!!! Instead he looks over then walks into the garage and chucks his glove in anger. Very Shocking and disgusted. Any thoughts.@Miles_raj @GMCricket @MichaelVaughan @benstokes38 We should let thugs go around, threatening people with broken bottles, should we? I would have helped those guys. You obviously side with the thug. The people he helped were grateful Ben came past. I don’t see Ben has a case to answer.  However I would jail the other guy.@B3cricket If I could afford it I would buy the lot. Wood Art. 👍👍@B3cricket 😂😂🤪@NumbersSTFC @damianholland4 @hazardeden10 Just like the old Italian tank. 5 gears backwards and 1 forward. An absolute shocking effort by Chelsea.@familyrouse No that is fantastic@NumbersSTFC He has scored more than I thought.@NumbersSTFC How many goals as he scored?@LawrenceV93 Hope is a good thing. Skill and speed will win this fight. Which means Eubanks wins by KO in 6. 🥊🥊🥊@SteveHaleGK Are you lost.@FJB19 @btsportcricket @bbctms No, that’s true. It would however free Root up, just to bat. Root to bat at 3 as well. However I think Livingstone is future England Captain.@FJB19 @btsportcricket @bbctms Just need to get the ECB on board.@FJB19 @btsportcricket @bbctms So you agree then. Test and one day captain 🏏👍@FJB19 @btsportcricket @bbctms Yes, his captaincy credentials are spot on, regardless of his batting form.@btsportcricket @bbctms @FJB19 How about we make Eoin Morgan our test and one day captain. He make not be the best player in test cricket. However he’s probably the captain in world cricket.@B3cricket thank you for a fantastic repair and the best quality service ever. Why go any where else. 👍👍 https://t.co/EcK7cRDC1d@bbctms @MichaelVaughan @HaseebHameed97 and  Adam lyth both play the short ball better than Stoneman. Also their foot work is better and both have scored more runs for England. Don’t forget @JetJennings@SamMorshead_ Do you think he should or Shouldn’t play? I think he should and should of played before now. Ali has played injured for the previous test and we have contested the Ashes with 10 men or less. Also Crane has taken wickets with the kookaburra ball. Play Crane@englandcricket @bbctms @btsportcricket Although adding Curren is a positive move, I feel England have given up on getting anything out Off this tour. It was a chance to play Crane who as a history of spinning the kookaburra ball. England are going back to the 80s. SOS ECB@TheCricketerMag Just getting Foakes a game, I’m a big Bairstow fan, I also believe it would effect his batting,if he gave up the gloves. I would like to see Gubbins In for Cook. In New Zealand@NumbersSTFC @Angiejanetads Rather be at the Darts 🍻🍻🤪🤪🤪@TheCricketerMag Yes, please play Crane, he can spin the kookaburra ball. Ask Western Australia. And Curran instead of Broad. Play Foakes as Keeper for the next 2 test and Bairstow as a batsman. See what happens, what have we got to lose.@EddieHearn Eddie is the Parker deal done. Giving us AJ fans an early Christmas Present?
