Tell her Kofi said hello...@_queen________ @kat_blaque @Blackamazon Wow is that I said? My bad... What I'm saying is... Sadly the amount of men of any race that are fully open and proud to be in a public relationships with a trans women is small... So if it's 10% of white men and 3% of black men... It's all kinda low@kat_blaque That's dope... I have trans friends who are in open public relationships with black men also... So shrug... I guess all men struggle with it...

Tall, male well dressed. Great personality, to keep the front of the spot clear of people harassing the patrons. Well spoken... Blah blah... Lemme know...@isaidwallahi 😂😂😂@tLicious11 Idk whenever I hear dudes talk like this I am so confused... Like who taught you this shit... How many pornos are there with guys eating pussy... Why don't think this is such a bad thing? These are the same dudes that think it's gay to moan during sexWell... This is a side of Khaled I didn't need to see... Lol... Someone tell him to shutup and scream about how they don't want us to win ASAP https://t.co/BxPOldjeXL@dietcokehead192 You are my bees wax!@dietcokehead192 Lol all you do is party and nap@lorearacelis Isn't weighing heavy on his heart... Or maybe it is@lorearacelis Ahhh... Yeah I honestly don't even think what he is being accused of is what he is referring too... I think he is speaking more to dogging girls our, breaking hearts, using them then ghosting, fuck boy shit... This forced kiss and him telling off college kids probably isn't what@lorearacelis I'm pretty sure he has been raped or molested... He keeps implying Yunior from his books has been and that seems like it's a stand in for himself@BriLaNEEK Lol yesY'all went through coon phases? I can't relate lolActually... I'm off this Junot Diaz shit... Alot of this sounds like typical egotistical celebrity bullshit right now... We will see... But I'ma just fall back for nowWow https://t.co/w6vigLSy87@kailaniskye Word... I'm with you but I can't be the one to say it... Lol@kailaniskye So far we got 1 person saying He kissed me... And 2 women saying he yelled at me... It's not too bad so far... Not to be insensitive... It's creepy and wrong... But not rape or anything@so14below Honestly... I just thought he was a womanizer... Not like, forcing anything... But I know it's possible based on his work...  But we will see... So far accusations seem to be 1. He kissed me, 2. He yelled at me... All wrong, one creeping and violating, but does it get worse?I'm wondering if more people will come forward about shit with Junot and if it will get any worse... 😓😥@zinziclemmons @kailaniskye@kailaniskye It's his turn apparentlyOne of my friends was like... "Y'all know Kanye is trolling y'all right" and I was like..."😐 This changes nothing... I hate trolls too"@kailaniskye Yea I just think that is typical fuck boy shit... Not like sexual assualt... He played themIt's pretty clear that Yunior basically is Junot... But while Yunior is a dog and kinda trash... i don't remember Yunior forcing himself on anyone... Did I miss that? He left that bit out I guess@maria_belford Damn! I was certain this was gonna be about him as a young teenager basically acting like Yunior from his stories... Not current day, woke, advocate Junot... Thats sucks@JoshuaKissi Cellphones damn near destroyed and entire telemarketing industry lol@maria_belford Wait what's going on with my cousin Junot??? 👀👀😣😣😓😓@Ubuntu_Queen @vidakahlo I find that both genders say they want boys becuz "theyre easier to raise" but really they aren't. People just don't raise their sons. All they do is restrict their daughter and tell them how to behave and let boys stay out and act a fool... They arent easier, ppl just aint tryin@I_M_NOTmyHAIR Fam bam@LifeAsBrinaa Oh right N yes we are waiting for ya fam@LifeAsBrinaa when y'all coming again?@Chaantellie @missD0MINIQUE Owww lol 👍🏾🤘🏾New York weather shut me up quick huh?He is living the life you want @HometownVenus https://t.co/erl8fG44e3😂😂😂 https://t.co/t8k1uNjHn3Ooooo I wanna see https://t.co/K6tMksxTbuWe had like 2 weeks of spring...
