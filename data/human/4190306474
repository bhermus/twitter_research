I've had it for about 13 years and played countless gigs with it...not to mention rehearsals! Still going strong. I love Hartke gear!Feeling a bit sore and roughed up after a 45 minute sparring session this morning. But gotta "hit" it again tomorrow.  
#boxing #keepimproving #nevergiveup@holyfield man...watching classic fights on YouTube. Awesome! Praise God@sandihartke Nice P Bass!Well....that was one loooong day!Saturday night at home. It's pretty good. Got the A/C cranking and Netfix is in my near future!Well....ceiling fan: 1 top of my head: 0
#notwinning@DrinkCraftBeer @BoleroSnort That sounds delicious!@UGAfootballLive Gooooo Dawgs!Boxing hurts. #thatisall@Robinet_Joe Any future possibility to order from Australia?@UGAfootballLive @skinnyqb10 DGD. I'm sure he'll do great things!My new bass is worth more than my car. Seriously. #gandlbasses #bass #rockI played bass so long today that my fingers are sore. That hasn't happened in a loooong time. #gigs #bassplayerGot several gigs this weekend.  Can't wait!I still have a month to wait for my new, custom G&amp;L LB-100 bass to arrive. Hurry up March! #bass #gandlbassesI joined a boxing gym 2 days ago.  #ouch@Incognicki Cause d minor is the saddest of all keys?@Thrillist @PabstBlueRibbon Drinking 12 beers while skiing? What could go wrong?@CrouchingMark @TerrapinBeerCo @crftbeerproject This sounds amazingThe weird thing is...I've never listened to punk. Maybe I should.I was a musician when I was 8 yrs old...I'm 43 now and still playing music...just for more money...but less self respectI can't wait for my new bass to arrive in Australia. G&amp;L you are the best! #lb100 #gandlbassesI went from acoustic to bass to lead electric...then back to bass. I think I'm home.  #bass@TaylorGuitars I have a satin top 1997 410ce guitar that is my most prized possession.  It is an incredible guitar that is on many albums. It sounds/plays so well. I love itI pulled out my 1997 Taylor 410ce acoustic tonight. I have a lot of time with that guitar....it's like a lover you still respect and kinda fear.How did I not become a punk? #seriously@Bully Been loving this band lately. Discovered them on premier guitar's rig rundownHating my own company@Incognicki Tell me more about these secret picklesThere's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.Give me a cigarette and 30 years and I would be a jazz musicianMiles and Coltrane are the bomb!!!Classically trained...jazz bridges the gap between classical and popular. But it is so foreign to modern listeners. I love jazz, it has all the balls of rock but requires a high level of proficiency that only trained musicians possess.Man...I want a miles/coltrane experience 
#bassI'm a closet jazz fan...there, I said it.@justinmj Stay the course dudeNo one will understand this, but I don't care..a few choices, a few moments in a different direction, a bit more bravery and my life would be completely different. #true #bass@UGAfootballLive Looks good to me...I'm 42 years old and I'm reflecting on my life decisions...heady stuffI had a scholarship to Berklee in 1993...but I went to UGA instead. I don't regret it, but I wonder where I'd be today. #bassI need a new band...like, now.
#bass #createartStaying up late like a rock star...living like a priestAlicia Bognanno inspires meI'm pretty sure I'm jaded...I miss the studio...I just watched a doco on Lemmy sober, now I'm afraid of the rock gods' judgementThe chick from @Bully looks like the first girl who broke my heart...only hotterI am looking for a band with vision who actually loves music. And you pay a bassist to fill out the bottom of the sound. #bassOk...seriously. I can play. I am experienced. Please hire me. #bass #rock #paidmydues@Bully if you ever need a new bassist...I'm your guy. No disrespect to the current dude, love his purple/blue
 P/J bass. I just love blonde musicians. And music. And rock@NEgense @Robinet_Joe Go to his website...@MissMargoPrice is the bomb. Who is her bass player? Love his bass and his tone. #bass #realcountryI've been so sad about UGA losing that I've only listened to country music and drank whiskey...
#justdamn #CFBChampionship #GoDawgsThis guy is a thinker... https://t.co/caHBWsDmJJI'm calling BS in that offsides penalty...
#GoDawgsHunker down Dawgs! 30 minutes left.
#GoDawgs #CFBPLAYOFF #CFPNationalChampionshipLooks like Hot Rod is gonna have to win it for us. #GoDawgs #CFBNationalChampionshipThe only thing I don't like about Coach Smart is that he wears visors.  #GoDawgs #CFBNationalChampionship 
#CFBPlayoffEat 'em up junkyard dawgs. #Dawgs #GoDawgsThis game makes me feel stressed. It's been a long time coming. We've got to win. #GoDawgs #Dawgs #UGAC'mon Dawgs put in the endzone. #GoDawgsThe Dawgs defense is hanging in there. Gotta get the offense clicking. #runtheball #Dawgs #UGAThat moment when you realize that the people closest to you would authentically be better off without you in their lives.Bam!!!! https://t.co/cTqvZE8ILq@UGAfootballLive ChubbChubb...power to break tackles and then accelerate past the rest. Awesome! https://t.co/E5NUunrNN2@Bryan_Brasher Rooster tail! Great lureSony Michel is a beast! #mvp #UGAI still can't believe the Dawgs are going to the National Championship. #UGA #godawgs@UGAAthletics Soooooo Good! Go Dawgs!Seriously, I've never heard so much bitterness from a fan. They keep saying it was the easy schedule that led to UGA's success.  You mean that easy 41-0 win over Tenn? #UGAI cannot believe how bitter some of my "friends" are about UGA's win over Oklahoma. They happen to be Tenn fans...figures. #UGA #godawgs@UGAfootballLive Ha ha...Had a new Australian experience yesterday...being stung by blue bottle jellyfish. #ouch #feeltheburn@BigMacBushcraft I don't like them personally...Merry Christmas!You know...being Southern is unique. It means something to me even though I can't express it sufficiently. Southern is special.Music and fishing are my 2 passions.Kayak fishing is the bomb. I love being on the waterI've been watching fishing on the Gold Coast to psych me up for Christmas holidays.  My son is the fish killa!!When I lived in the States I wanted to be a BASS pro...now my old tackle box is dry rotting.  #sadday #ineedtogofishing@sandihartke Awesome bass!@TymGuitars Thank you!@TymGuitars Show the rest of it!@SummitsSnell @TeamTrivia If only I didn't live in Australia...I love the whole experience of being in a band...rehearsals, gigs, studios, travel, backstage, boredom, drama, etc. It is all wonderful.Why doesn't @TheRyanAdams call me to play bass? That's right...we've never met. #ilove4hoursets #bassI'm looking for a challenging, new gig...Critics and business has burned down creative space for artists for far too long. Time to rebuild in a new format/template.I have a jam band that could be epic...except that none of us care and we're too busy. #justdamn #ohwell #missedopportunityWhen you buy a bass you have to buy other things...
Strap, strap locks, case, new strings...etc. it costs a lit to buy a new bass. #gandlbassesSky Blue Sky is still my fav Wilco album. It is perfect.  #WILCO #oneanda3My fav "record" moment is Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. My brother and I were together as we drove thru the Blue Ridge Parkway. No one spoke, we just listened.Wilco makes albums that you come back to, to remember important moments of life. Sort of like Pink Floyd. #wilcoI remember listening...really listening...to Wilco in Italy in 2006 for the 1st time. I put on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot while driving one arvo. #magic #wilco #hookedforlife@UGAfootballLive Goooooo Dawgs!!@Incognicki Hilarious@Oneanda3 Thanks mate, you too.101 takes a while to kick inWilco just let the hired gun play a solo... #nice #justdamn #iamjealous
#iwishiwasthebassistSometimes the only thing that makes sense to me is musicOne wing will never fly...we can only wave goodbye.I like calling guys named James, "Jimmy". #yeahWhat do you do if like someone on a different continent? Anybody hiring bass in the USA?@Oneanda3 I'm watching a show on YouTube from a couple of weeks ago...Wilco never ceases to satisfy.  So good and authentic. Your bass playing is so solid! #thanksNever seen Jeff Tweedy with a Strat...Nels Cline is my fav guitarist of all time! He is the best.5 shots fired...still standingMy new bass is loaded with meaning. It's black with a tortoiseshell pickguard for Nels and Ryan Adams. It has block inlay for the 70's when I was born. It's a P bass because...Atlanta has snow in December...crazy times!I haven't bought Wild Turkey 101 since college...what does that say about my choices?Impossible Germany...or likely Japan.
#wilcoHow do you become popular on Twitter? I'm asking for a friend...@Incognicki Christmas and Easter and my birthday and President's day...well, not President's day but you get the idea...Just watched a doco on Groupies from the 60-70's called "Let's Spend the Night Together" It was very interesting to see the music thru their eyes.  None of them are married now...why?Just putting it out there: Wilco is the best band. #SorryNotSorryI cannot wait for my new bass to arrive so I can plug in to my Hartke rig and rumble. #gandlbasses #lb100 #hartke@Incognicki I hate it when that happensHahaha. It's funny cause it's true
 https://t.co/Kqo8B6ZrM6Seriously, I need to play bass. Right now. And with some talented musicians.I haven't been myself lately. I just realized that my bass playing has been inconsistent with the same group of people. I need a good jam with like minded musicians.  I need a band.What does rock n roll smell like. Asking for a friend...
#smokeandwhiskey #stalebeerRedheads...
#justdamnI'm surprised by how many people still smoke. Like, how do you afford it?I'm excited and anxious about UGA replaying Auburn for the SEC Championship. We'll never hear tge end of it if we lose. #GodawgsI'm sitting at a bar and there's a girl who's had a few too many talking a little too loud. But she has cool tattoos. #checkpleaseI've decided to go backpacking over Christmas holidays. I need the solitude and challenge.@Incognicki What's Reddit? I'm old and uncoolJust a few of the family... https://t.co/0WVzFzqa26@Incognicki See...this pic is vague, but you're clearly hot (not fat or undesirable in any way). Good use of puppy distractions too...I love this bass rig.

You know it's for the best, but it's hard. #justdamn #plzforgivemeSonic Youth liked drugs a lot...just saying as I watch this documentaryMy second Taylor410ce toured with me through the late 90's- 2000's. Lots of gigs...lots of memories.  2nd guessing selling it...for a new custom bassJust sold a sentimental guitar, an amp, and a chorus pedal to pay for a new bass. #justdamn #g&amp;llb100 #areyousureWatching a grunge doco from 1991. Man, I wish I could be 17 again. But know what I know now. #dangerous@Incognicki happy thanksgiving!@Incognicki I'm a day ahead and drunk...so, wise advise. But I'm not drivingKim Gordon used to play a Thunderbird...very cool. #thunderbird@OteilBurbridge As a bassist...I have so much respect for what you do.
