@EricRWeinstein @RichardDawkins @BretWeinstein Already got my ticket!Watching #NHLPlayoffs is going to take years off my life. Let‚Äôs go Pens!@JumboHart How is Fred taking this news? üòÇ@MLBJesus @PlantationCane he should have never cut his hairThe over the top trumpian rhetoric aside this is actually a great idea. I think this would prevent the ‚Äúcareer politician‚Äù and would go a long way toward solving some of the problems in Washington. https://t.co/87L5ypmZQ3@mcnees Was that a typical dissertation length back then?@RyanHannable Yay we don‚Äôt have anyone like that on the roster@ezlazar I guess that‚Äôs something...although it‚Äôs not saying much if he‚Äôs more athletic than what we have.@asauce15 @jords_mac @geoffschwartz @patspulpit It‚Äôs not a joke. Jones is a bust and will not make the team. Those other guys are mostly older. They just need LB and DE more because we don‚Äôt have any good players there besides Hightower.@JumboHart Pats fans let‚Äôs not hold our breath. We haven‚Äôt had a pass rush in years and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs ever bothered B.B. but hey I‚Äôm sure there is a special teams safety none of us have heard of that he is eyeing up at #43.@ezlazar Don‚Äôt underestimate Bill‚Äôs ability to fall madly in love with a special teams safety that none of us have heard of and take him in the second round.@RyanHannable We don‚Äôt know what the plan is yet, but my initial reaction is why not just sign our young stud Mason to a long term extension and use that #23 pick on defense. It‚Äôs just hard for me to buy that Wynn is a tackle.@jords_mac @geoffschwartz @patspulpit I will be so sad if we are watching them get shredded helplessly in the playoffs again with the opposing QB pitching a tent behind his O-line.@jords_mac @geoffschwartz @patspulpit I‚Äôm fine with DT, but there isn‚Äôt one legitimately decent pass rushers on the edge. I really think they need at least one athletic coverage LB and someone who can get to QB@geoffschwartz @patspulpit And still don‚Äôt have a defense...@JumboHart Yay who needs any talent on the front sevenThis Pens game is hard to watch...Capitals could easily be up 3 right now #NHLPlayoffsThis is true. https://t.co/zYNBuxva23@JumboHart @pfwpaul @E_Scal i feel very strongly that the Pats need to add at least 2 athletic, playmaking talents to this front seven with our top 4 picks. 1 on the edge and 1 at LB. If we can do that and add a tackle I will be very happy with this draft.@RyanDantonio Yeah he is the exact opposite of a jet. If he said he‚Äôs just looking to get the most amount of money for the least amount of effort AND be guaranteed the ability to golf in Jan and Feb...he‚Äôd be a perfect jet.This guy is a Patriot https://t.co/21XjaNMKX3@ShaunKing Seems like you are the bigot to assume her motives and decide that she is just trying to appease other people. She‚Äôs allowed to have her own legitimate opinion on this issue and it is disgusting for you as a white person to just dismiss it.YES YES YES. @SenSchumer I agree with you on this issue, but also more broadly on your philosophical rediscovery of federalism. It would be great if both parties could get back to this a guiding principle for policy. https://t.co/P2JVz14Abd@AstroKatie I think this is a good expectation just based on the fact that the reader is attempting to learn something about what they already know to be somewhat complex in even picking up the book.@robertmays That whole 59 Sound album is perfect.@MichaelDavSmith Great QB but idk how anyone could think he‚Äôs better than Brady Manning or Rodgers. At best he‚Äôs behind those guys.@patspulpit I am coveting Evans@mcnees @Twitter I disagree with you pretty strongly here...half the things I see on Twitter are patently false. If people are dumb and spreading false things that doesn‚Äôt mean it is evil or harassment it just hurts their own reputations. Don‚Äôt think they should be reported or banned.@mikefreemanNFL I agree that college players should be paid. Just out of curiosity what do you think that system should look like? Free market where players just go to the highest bidder?@Sportstein @RyanDantonio look at this!@michaeljknowles What is she getting her PhD in?@pepper_chico @AstroKPJ Thank you!!!!@AstroKPJ Just out of curiosity how are images that represent the Schwartzchild metric like the one here made?@BrittMcHenry Lol not if you play the Pens again ;)@ElsieEigers At least Warren can form coherent sentences lol@DMooreNFL Can we stop listing Slater with the receivers? He doesn‚Äôt play the position and is completely and utterly irrelevant for that position‚Äôs depth chart. His name shouldn‚Äôt even come up.@Taden90 Yes. And edge defenders.@charliekirk11 Sources on those numbers?@JumboHart Can you guys do a PFW today? I don‚Äôt want to wait for tomorrow to get your analysis on the trade and draft options.Wow talk about a third degree burn https://t.co/zui0AUHEWg@caraaaaaa I can‚Äôt stand how this organization treated him at the end. Just infuriating.Ummm King is freaking incredible. @Patriots phone his agent right now. https://t.co/0JhJnlpcUO@KassyDillon In what field?@HashtagGriswold *written by a former SCOTUS memberThis is a legitimate narrative problem I think the left has. It is hard to consistently argue all of these points which many (but not all) liberal leaning individuals do. https://t.co/jn6iNBGrbc@DanHooperAstro You should put out your reading list for the class!@ClayTravis @espn I don‚Äôt have a problem with this take. He is saying that if these accusations turn out to be unsubstantiated Bennett has been treated wrongly because of how people will perceive him. So, the accusation should have merit and be supported with evidence.@seanmcarroll Please do!!!! I think it would be really great because you have interesting and well informed thoughts on a variety of topics.@charliekirk11 Pretty sure our homicide rate is higher though@superben21 Yes that is even betterBrilliant idea. Grocery stores where cards are the only acceptable method of payment.@seanmcarroll Not an expert by any means, but it always sounded like a pretty sweet deal to work only 9 months out of the year with lots of time off baked into those 9 months as well. The figures I‚Äôve seen from personal anecdotes of teachers I‚Äôve known always seemed pretty decent.@stoolpresidente She did her job and dumped his ass after he signed with Miami.Cardi B is my new hero https://t.co/wUEpofH7SZ@whygavs Love this thread. Out of curiosity what did you do your PhD in?@robertmays Listening to today‚Äôs podcast rn. I hope I run into you on the streets of Chicago one of these days!@mcnees This one is the best lmao@PatskriegDotCom I wanted him at like 1 year 2.5 million as a flyer lol@ezlazar Is it just me or does he not look as fast as he is supposed to be on tape?@robertmays He‚Äôs played with Brady, Manning, and Rodgers in the same league pretty much his whole career. Tough competition.@DMooreNFL Yeah but we already have a ton of core special teamers. Ebner, king, bolden...how many guys that don‚Äôt do anything else can we have on the roster?@DMooreNFL Eh he plays special teams and is hurt half the time anyway. Doesnt really matter that much either way.@patspulpit üòî @DannyAmendola please come back soon.@DannyAmendola Gonna miss you so much.@DanHooperAstro Thank you!@DanHooperAstro What Hawking papers would you recommend to an interested person with a good undergrad background?@_lunardreams @BrockOgami Yeah i don‚Äôt think it mattered because we‚Äôve seen any back who gets goal line touches score lots of TDs in this offense. That has never not been the case. Ridley, Blount, Burkhead, Green-Ellis...none of those guys are good.@_lunardreams @BrockOgami No context? I am agreeing with you that he wasn‚Äôt very good but provided you with an example of another not good RB who scored a ton of TDs at the goal line. If you kept feeding him carries there he easily would have finished with 10+.@_lunardreams @BrockOgami Blount got 18 TDS as our goal line back averaging 3.9 yards per carry which is objectively bad for an NFL RB. You can put anyone in that role. Don‚Äôt think it matters much and would still much rather have Lewis.@_lunardreams @BrockOgami He didn‚Äôt play much. Was inactive for half the season but got 5 TDS in 100 attempts@BrockOgami @_lunardreams When you need two yards and you have the versatile offense Pats have i think you can give anyone goal line carries and they‚Äôll score a lot. I‚Äôm talking more about productivity running in any situation.@sevastra82 @globejimmcbride @Patriots @RBrex2022 They are both injury prone. But one guy is an impact player and the other isn‚Äôt.@BrockOgami I don‚Äôt think so. At least to my eye, Rex doesn‚Äôt have anywhere near the physical gifts that Lewis has in terms of his ability to stop/start instantly in the open field and playing strength when between tackles.@BrockOgami Disagree...it depends on the numbers but I‚Äôll bet we gave him an APY close to 70/80% of what Lewis is getting. Lewis is an impact guy. Burkhead isn‚Äôt. And was barely on the field.@globejimmcbride @Patriots @RBrex2022 Couldn‚Äôt care less. Dude is a dime a dozen back whose production you could easily replace on the scrap heap. Also most injury prone guy on the roster. Much rather would have seen us pay a little more for an impact guy like Lewis.@seanmcarroll And one of those isn‚Äôt a scientist...@ezlazar Yeah i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs good. That contract was way too rich for him.THE GOAT https://t.co/uUWztN8K3R@HeatherJuliaa Rookie move@RyanDantonio @patspulpit Nvm Ryan you have me sold. I‚Äôm all in on Mo Wilkerson now!@Peter_Bukowski I was very against that and don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that great either. He‚Äôs more physically gifted but overall he‚Äôs just a corner that you are okay starting out there. He‚Äôs not going to change your defense in any major way.@Peter_Bukowski Ugh...I‚Äôd much rather take a chance in a CB in first or second round than pay him that much. I wouldn‚Äôt want to pay any of those guys that much.@Peter_Bukowski What contract would you give him as a GM?@Peter_Bukowski He‚Äôs on a high profile team and made arguably the most memorable NFL play of the last decade so sure he‚Äôll make things like the pro bowl. I‚Äôve watched every snap he has played and he‚Äôs fine, but is not a shut down/number 1 guy. That‚Äôs what he‚Äôll be paid like though.@Eric19682045 @Peter_Bukowski That‚Äôs not saying a lot with how terrible the defense was this year. Butler is an okay player who can start for you. But he is nowhere near a number 1 corner and anyone who pays him that way will be very disappointed.@Peter_Bukowski Don‚Äôt get me wrong he‚Äôs alright, but I think anyone who pays him 8-10+ million APY is going to cut him the second they pay him his last cent of guaranteed money.@Peter_Bukowski Jones is the only one who I would say has really been a difference maker for his new team. As a Pats fan though, super bowl issues aside butler was not good in coverage this year. I went from wanting to sign him to wishing we had traded him for a decent pick while we still could.@RichardDawkins Come to Chicago!!!!!@patspulpit No thanks...he seems like a guy who took his money and checked out. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a guy who would fit well in Pats program.@BenVolin @JumboHart @pfwpaul @E_Scal look at these numbers...he was really darn good last year. Would have given him the contract if he had performed like that in NE.@BenVolin Why wasn‚Äôt he anywhere near this good with us?@BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg I don‚Äôt quite follow how you can get rid of free will without physical determinism. To me they kind of have to go hand in hand.@DanHooperAstro Wow!!! This course sounds incredible. Really wish an offering like this was more common in physics and philosophy departments.@WKCosmo @erikverlinde Do you have any paper recommendations that go into more of the details for these two methods?@erikverlinde @WKCosmo Yikes...do we have any idea on what‚Äôs going on here?@SI_PeterKing Get ready for lots and lots of fumbles.This is awful...complete economic ignorance here. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/CWOIlVGxmhüòçüòçüòç https://t.co/LfV9pyQvsX@Peter_Bukowski I‚Äôm pretty down on mariota, Winston, and Carr especially. Looks like their development has been pretty badly stunted. Could maybe see Prescott or Goff emerge as better but still question marks with them.@Peter_Bukowski I would say he is definitely better than Mariota, Winston, Prescott, Carr, and Goff.@HashtagGriswold Can one‚Äôs JD be retroactively revoked? His ignorance of the law and constitution isn‚Äôt really in question at this point.@RossTuckerNFL Yeah but when have the refs are behaved this way?@bigjimmurray Guys he is just trying really hard to be edgy with these takes.@mcnees Any good resources to learn about the actual data and how it was analyzed to produce these maps?@michaeljknowles It‚Äôs more complicated than this. There‚Äôs a lot about the initial singularity that we don‚Äôt understand and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily prove that there was a moment of creation. Further theoretical developments could very well remove the need to invoke an ‚Äúinstant‚Äù of creation.@stevensonds94 The number and scope of failures at so many levels here is simple astonishing. It is actually hard to comprehend how this specific situation happened given that if someone had done their job 1 time out of 50 some situations this would have been prevented.@stevensonds94 I‚Äôll pass on trusting the government to protect me. The more we learn the stronger the case gets for the 2nd amendment.I don‚Äôt know how but every day law enforcement keeps looking worse and worse. With every bit of new information it becomes clearer and clearer that we need to be responsible for our own defense. The FBI and sheriff‚Äôs office should be disgusted with themselves. https://t.co/KCNVSHaz0L@superben21 Perhaps. Idk though i don‚Äôt remember things being like this in the early and mid 2000s but i also wasn‚Äôt old enough to pay as much attention.@superben21 Doesn‚Äôt exist anymoreThis keeps getting worse and worse...where was law enforcement?? FBI and Local enforcement really failed everyone here. https://t.co/v1h46dcAdjFrustrating that almost no one is willing to have an open honest discussion about these issues. The right has gone after the kids as ‚Äúactors‚Äù and the left has gone after law abiding citizens as ‚Äúkillers‚Äù and selectively used victims to push their narrative. Awful all around. https://t.co/jVyQB0glKG@duetosymmetry Where can this be downloaded?@EricRWeinstein I love your perspective on science and would really enjoy some talks on geometry, GR, quantum mechanics etc.@EricRWeinstein Please talk about physics and math!!!!!‚ÄúProtocols were not followed‚Äù. This should have never happened. https://t.co/oxjTXHtakRThis is astounding...last month concerned individuals were reporting to the proper law enforcement channels and nothing was done. There is no excuse for this type of gross incompetence. https://t.co/JjePExadAZ@politicalelle Hi Erielle you mentioned before that you used to work on Wall Street.
