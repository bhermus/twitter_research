I am doomed that horse will ruin me.*sees how much he’s lost on horse races he knows nothing about before the derby even started*

And I am obsessed with the prospect of a vengeful horse.There’s a lot of great ways to bet on the Kentucky Derby and of you want to bet on Justify I would not fault you at all for it (I would even recommend it)
