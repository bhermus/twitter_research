Or am I just becoming so much more aware of how horrible people can be on a daily basis?Also -- take a look into capitalization. Maybe you shouldn't capitalize that word that's not a proper noun. (And in this case, maybe means never.) #grammariskillingmetodayThe Oxford comma makes me want to puke.I’ve been away from Callie for one day and I miss that furball already. 😽Got tennis AND a run in today and I’m pretty happy about that fact.Glad @BAKilley is having fun in Nashville but I’m ready for her to get back to me ...I checked in at Yelp's Futuristic Fiesta at VisionLoft #Yelp #Yelfie https://t.co/tbyk2OGOkB https://t.co/RlmlbY6ymYI checked in at The Barre Code Indianapolis on #Yelp https://t.co/sEwnF307cfI'm hungry just thinking about #YelpsFuturisticFiesta ... @YelpIndy https://t.co/o2sp1ob1qWAnd this, my friends, is why I love barre. @BarreCode_Indy https://t.co/k0UsNpbe7j@brittsmithindy It really is!My last month of my 20’s ... 🤔🤔🤔I’m seeking an enthusiastic summer intern @BACAIndy!☀️ https://t.co/yDTLpPw8AA https://t.co/7YsFbuwJJ5@jessieraesmith @IMS I’ll join you!I’m a definite pro at not sleeping.Looking forward to attending "AMA Circle Social with PERQ!"
