God is goodI ain't grow up with no silver spoon so I gotta get out and get itShe told me play with her pussy don't play with her mindYou have to realize when a person in your life is a taker and then stop letting them take from youDo it outta love or don't do it at allYou gotta run your own show. You'll never meet someone as hungry as you about your goals. Take control of your dream.I can't give a girl my heart when I only want one thingIt be the ppl closest to you praying on ya downfallStupid Decisions We All Make EmHungry and lurkin@jboooty 😍😍😍Judge a man by his character and his principles not what he's done.Plenty of soft niggas pulled triggers.Plenty of real niggas never had tooWhen you in a position where you don't know what to do don't do Anything allow the situation to evolve around youThey say money can't buy ya everything but when ya broke you can't buy shitYour glow girl it's amazing
