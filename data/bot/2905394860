@KristenSmash Jake has too many fathers to keep track of. 😂 #GH #Lucky #Drew #Jason #Franco 😂😂@GHships Yes, refreshing is the word. You said it!As much as I’ve loved some of Anna’s past pairings, I’m really hoping to see the Anna &amp; Finn romance go into high gear now.  We need some happiness for our Anna! (And we need a happy distraction from all the Heinrich Faison stuff!) #GH #Fanna https://t.co/Os3fYGELNQ@whitewatercrew Robin on #GH with someone, or with a GH star on another show/film? Hints Hints please! ☺️@Rowaenthe 😢@FriendsTV Like it was yesterday.@JaSamHive I knew that would happen. True #Jasam love brings the viewers &amp; ratings - just like in March on the day they professed their love.  (Same with last Nov.  It wasn’t just Steve’s return; it was the promise of Sam &amp; Jason together / OGJasam. 🙌🏼🤟🏼❤️#GH@mtomaone1 I’d kinda like him with Liz Webber though.  Maybe LH can just be independent for a while...@MaryLevesley @valentinifrank @1SteveBurton @finolahughes @GeneralHospital Okay, that sounds good! 
😂🤣😂🤣@MaryLevesley @valentinifrank @1SteveBurton @finolahughes @GeneralHospital I love Curtis except for his occasional bad grammar. (I don’t need no bad grammar in my entertainment. 😂)@valentinifrank @1SteveBurton @finolahughes @GeneralHospital Completely awesome!!! Love them working together.  I want Jason &amp; Spinelli (and maybe even Sam) working for Anna / WSB. 👌🏼 #GH@BuyingAir I’m down for a lot more of Liz btw! 😉@BuyingAir Actually, I I think that’s just what they need.  It’s often too male heavy right now (in terms of who gets the focus anyway). I was worried they were going to bring back JJ / Lucky which would result in way too many male leads.@AshleyChamberla I know!  Both very dynamic actresses too!) I think some people once suggested they recast Robin’s role with Elizabeth.  I’d want a new role for Elizabeth, though.   Kimberly will always be Robin to me.)That’s exciting about Elizabeth Hendrickson joining the cast of #GH.  The cast is too huge, but she’s SO amazing.  (I wish Rebecca B. could return too.)

If Anna had a mystery daughter long ago, she should be played by Elizabeth who looks WAY more like Anna then Wes/Peter. https://t.co/OrzulsPE72@chloelanier Congrats on your Emmy!!! I knew you’d win.  You’re one amazing actress!!! #GH https://t.co/m71KRQHzHO@RoyaleVision @bridgetberlyn Lol! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

Charlotte actually has way more of Williams genetic material than any son would.  The X chromosome (eg. Will’s X chromosome) has approximately 800 genes, whereas the Y chromosome has only around 70 genes.@GalaxyAliceHood People aren’t going to agree with me, but ... maybe Nelle! #Saint&amp;Sinner #GH@japastu  https://t.co/8k7ysk2NRj@jasamRideorDie What’s better granola or gogurt?@paula_30throad I hope they live happily ever after.Anna should get Spinelli to remotely complete her computer hacking. Also, she should show that school photo to Dr. O. to confirm if Henri is Heinrich. (Come to think of it, why hasn’t Dr. O. run into Peter in Port Charles and recognized him?) #GH https://t.co/yaqp247QcZSending a ton of love and  
appreciation out to Kelly Monaco!!! #SamFF #Jasam or #DreAm fans have all loved her so much (despite their crazy disputes).  She gives it her all every day to bring us the captivating character of Sam! 😘 @kellymonaco1 Monaco1 #GH. https://t.co/vOBQZpx2NT@bettebo2 @TaraSoNotty Yes, I’ve noticed it in scenes before too.  (During identity reveal, when Drew was being rude to him, Jason really stayed focused only on Sam.) ❤️@Rowaenthe The lawyers should be able to figure it out.  Remember though that both Julian and Jason were happy to be generous with (give a very good deal to) Sam.  Drew wouldn’t have that company without her.  Maybe he can pay off Jason and also compensate Sam - and then keep the company.@BfordAnderson Love you Bradford / Spinelli !!!@LMH224 @Rere9100009 @KimberlyAFarris @GeneralHospital Good point@MadreneBoyle @finolahughes @tristanrogers @MichaelEaston Very soapy! Loved that!LOVED the Anna, Robert &amp; Finn storyline today!!! Romance, intrigue &amp; comic moments with 3 of #GH’s best characters ever.  

Robert &amp; Anna are always pure GOLD.  Finn brings in a nice fresh dimension. 

#RnA #Fanna

👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼❤️👏🏼 https://t.co/MwXxJQWAq6@376shannon 😂🤣😂@376shannon That’s it!!!! Exactly!!!! 👍🏼Poor Anna!  That couch looks so uncomfortable.  It must be a few decades old. 🙊 (Loving the Anna &amp; Robert scenes by the way.  They deserve much better furniture.)#GH https://t.co/E5PxbmdlBlEpiphany sighting 👏🏼 - more @TheRealSonyaEd would be wonderful!!!! #GH https://t.co/PCProTJiZd@FriendsTV Phoebe@tristanrogers Wonderful having you back!!! Robert &amp; Anna are always great together. Love you and Finola!@ZinaMarie70 @MariaInNC @DogznCatz 😂@ZinaMarie70 @MariaInNC @DogznCatz But what do we really think of polls? They’re ...@paula_30throad @1SteveBurton ☺️@Soccermom1714 Yes, and the character was so perverse.@paula_30throad @1SteveBurton 😂 Lol about the teenage daughter!  Nice collage!Is it Alex Devane?? She called Emma “Emmer” (a very British pronunciation) when usually Anna says Emma these days. Also, so concerned about style... taking Emma on a “mission”?(Then again, I doubt Alex could fool Emma.) #GH #Anna 🤔 https://t.co/o1nQetWetN@lee3988 Yes, that’s the place!@MysticOlive 😢@Halleywood True.  Jason looks great in a blue dress-shirt.  (I think Maxie once pointedthat out to him.) 😊 #GHI’m not gonna lie, I’m looking forward to seeing Jason in that suit.  Way to go Emma &amp; Anna! #GH https://t.co/bkaTxgsxGp@MayaVashti So far at 0% the Silent Generation is looking pretty silent indeed.  I’m guessing they’re probably watching but not tweeting. #GH.Will Anna, Emma, Jason, Spinelli, Sam, Danny and Scout all meet up in Europe?  Maybe they’ll encounter Laura and Spencer too ...and maybe Robert!  What a party! (Hopefully it’s safe!!! At least we know Heinrich is likely not a threat to them and is actually in Port Charles.) #GH https://t.co/pA2qiVA9ZZ@Jade_Buddha1 And those Disney fireworks will also be reminding Sam of her New Year’s Eve kiss with her true love, Jason. #GH #Jasam https://t.co/2CmHdAvquf@aroundash01 @kellymonaco1 True!  She deserves a break!  She’s given so much to her recent scenes.@phyllissmith650 I’m more of a #Jasam fan - hoping for a Sam and Jason romance leading up to a reunion.  😊@kathyLe02717648 Oh yeah baby! 🔥 https://t.co/P1rZPUFo1o😂 Nelle and Joss are both  
reincarnations of Carly ...Carly’s earlier evil side and her later nicer but still mischievous side!  It’s fun to watch these two interact. (Fun to see them with Carly too.) #GH @chloelanier @RealEdenMccoy 👏🏼#Jelle https://t.co/sdTZAjZ4arWatching #GH now ...@tkweaveractor @LabsandMoreSD Both of you are completely adorable.  I bet he will chew up a lot of stuff!! I had a beagle that chewed up an entire sofa when he was young. Enjoy the fun!!@OhSoFrieda @cristinfrazier @MyKillySoul I think some of the peer judges are jealous of Kelly’s incredible popularity with fans.  Also, it’s always been more of an uphill battle for Italian and other ethnic actresses at the Emmys - wasn’t easy for even Susan Lucci.  Kelly’s time will come though!!! #SamFF #GH https://t.co/usVqJzEqdII’m going through Sam withdrawal.  I’m going to need Kelly Monaco &amp; Sam back on #GH pronto.  (I hope Sam doesn’t need too many days to think.) 

#SamFF #Jasam https://t.co/6sBaTO1Clh@valentinifrank @RebeccaLHerbst @Hudsonwest1 @GeneralHospital This 👇🏼 https://t.co/wAjBM75u9j@shonnia21 Haha, that must have been for their honeymoon.@Rowaenthe Yes, we will. ☺️ (By the way, I like your use of the semicolon there; people don’t use nice punctuation like that often enough these days. 👍🏼☺️)@Rowaenthe Very true! (Still, I think the writers are getting things set up for a fun story.  First Anna &amp; Finn pretended to be in a relationship.  Now they will have to pretend not to be in one - with antics between Alexis and Finn at the same time.  🤣)Anna talking about how it “did sting” seeing Alexis with Finn. 😂 So cute.  I do like these two!
#FAnna #GH. https://t.co/iVqxc0Cnaj@kellysmom1 You’re a classy lady.  Yes, congrats to all.  

It’s baffling that Kelly wasn’t nominated too.  It’s Kelly that keeps the audience engaged more than any actress in daytime.  She is so beloved as is her character Sam.@paula_30throad I wanted to be her.  ☺️  (Still kinda do.)@paula_30throad I loved her!!! ☺️I like the Charlie’s Angels gifs people are posting relating to Sam &amp; Liz!  Now we just need a third angel!  How about #Hayden? 🙏🏼 #GH #SaLiz https://t.co/PREFF0daEi@paula_30throad  https://t.co/QQI0pUvfITOkay @OGChrisVanEtten, could we make it turn out that Jason killed Franco long ago and RoHo’s character is his twin Bobby (who had Franco’s memories due to mind mapping).  Character fixed! #GH   🙏🏼@dawn9476 Still, some people have argued that Duke was a thug and a criminal not worthy of Anna.  (I disagree with that btw.) #GH@dawn9476 I think despite being connected to organized crime, Jason is a pretty good guy ...much like Duke. He is often very heroic ...eg. crashing through the skylight, chasing the really bad guys, diving into the water and saving Sam. https://t.co/KVFqRjrYgDHow does Finola Hughes have such amazing chemistry with all her screen partners?  Having #Anna and #Jason working together reminds me of those Avengers or DC moments when two super cool superheroes team up! #GH #Janna #Anson https://t.co/plpXKKdADh@GeneralHospital Sam: “Come on Elizabeth...”

Liz &amp; Sam teaming up 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Bravo!!! Lots of fun!!!! 

We need these two together more!! #GH #SaLiz https://t.co/xBREE6dOCI@valentinifrank @1SteveBurton @finolahughes @GeneralHospital Very Awesome!! Loved the connection Anna &amp; Jason had (including the Robin references)! #Janna #GH@shaylaswayze3 @tkweaveractor @kellymonaco1 @1SteveBurton It’s nice that Danny looks like both parents. The hair colour is especially like Jason’s /Steve Burton’s when he was young. https://t.co/illDT00Tu1@KSuz97 Absolutely not@eliosoliver_ That would be amazing.@MimiC1019 😂🤣So what if they have the same shoes?  Nobody mentions that Will and Harry’s shoes are the same - and they pretty much are.  #Kate #Meghan #Will #Harry https://t.co/RpW76SAios@SpinsVixenella Didn’t Anna go to Belgium?@lindsayk77 Although ....they aren’t really real life, but I hear you.  They’re real to us!!ALWAYS love Epiphany on #GH.  This character really enriches the show!! More, more! @TheRealSonyaEd @valentinifrank @OGChrisVanEtten https://t.co/JHQlTe300r@barbiedoll311 @SweetPoison014 @finolahughes Could there be a twist?  It really is a daughter?@Alison711029 @finolahughes Precisely!Well, @finolahughes was fabulous today &amp; I’ve decided to enjoy this story of her having another daughter or son.  Faison is dead, so it’s not about him.  For me, this is Anna Devane’s child.  As such, he or she will be precious. I feel the emotion in Anna’s soul. #GH https://t.co/7FggMfuMSBOnce upon a time indeed ... now we just need a happily ever after. #Jasam #JaSamReunion2018 #GH https://t.co/PPXSW10mqcI really like #Tolly, such an adorable pair together! #GH #Molly #TJ https://t.co/XIdGf7WLzE@valentinifrank @GeneralHospital Loving the #Jasam and #Tolly moments especially!!! Thanks!!@soapsfan6789 I did both.  Bigger fan of #Jtoria though!@Soap_Hub No, just no.#YR They’re just so adorable. #Jtoria ❤️✨ https://t.co/G8kZyAFRsJFinola Hughes and James Patrick Stuart performed this amazingly, but I agree this tale of Anna sexually exploiting Faison - not cool. #GH https://t.co/pVZTyG5hW9Peter watching his mom, sister and step brother grieving for his brother...angsty. #GH #Anna #Robin #Griffin #Heinrich https://t.co/RAzIF8IGjw@pamabby1 @GHships True!  I hope he also missed Amelia! 😉
