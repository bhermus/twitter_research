@KnickFilmSchool @TheKnicksWall wondering - could the improved finishing from Conley etc just be because Gasol was spaced out to the 3pt line dragging the opposing big out of the lane? Looking briefly at nbawowy it seems the non-Kanter Knicks shot way better at the rim (and more often) without Kanter in there@lepton939 @StevePopper @northjersey Lol great minds think alike@StevePopper @northjersey I think the press has under-covered how Harvey was basically guilted/peer-pressured by management and the press into pitching too much during the WS year. Boras (and science) said he was being overextended, and he was right. Ramping up too fast = major injury the next year@hbryant42 Fizdale@charliezegers @TheKnicksWall Except Kawhi is 5x the player Carmelo was even at his best@GangGreenNation No one wants Hackenberg?@KnickerBlogger I love baker and Rosen too@KnickerBlogger No Darnold?@Schmeelk @Giants What’s the point of keeping everyone guessing when you have the first pick? Does he think people won’t have contingency plans no matter who they pick?@Schmeelk @NYPost_Berman i'd easily give them any second round pick we own if $$ doesn't get it done. dude is an elite defensive coach, modern offensively, does a great job developing young and mid-career guys (Carroll, THJ, Bazemore, Mike Scott, Muscala, even Millsap). he's everything we want.@LockedOnKnicks @MikeVorkunov @ThompsonScribe @AndyKHLiu you guys did podcasts within days of each other with completely different takes on Mark Jackson. Who’s right? Maybe a 4way pod?@FisolaNYDN Honestly it is your job to at least ask the question- is being black a prerequisite for the job? Again I appreciate that there are too few black coaches in the league and admire their desire in this sense, but I don’t think interviewing Kenny smith is the way to do it@FisolaNYDN They want to hire a black coach. Which is fine in principle but that doesn’t mean you don’t even consider nonblack coaches. Blatt feels like a courtesy interview for a friend@ChrisIseman If they interview Kenny smith then it’s clear all the reasons for not interviewing JVG are made up. They should just come out and say they want to hire a black coach. I support hiring a black coach but don’t think it should be a necessary trait@KnickFilmSchool @ChinaJoeFlynn @TheSteinLine Yeah this Mark Jackson is beloved by Knicks  fans is completely exaggerated. Most of us who remember him remember him best as a pacer. We couldn’t care less that he went to St. John’s. @TheSteinLine@SportsCenter @ESPNNFL And Brandon Marshall@alanhahn All you have to do is hear him talk about the job and the Knicks and you know he wants the job badly@4BLoCk_DoT @nyknicks @MarkJackson13 @MettaWorldPeace @MikeWoodsonNBA @alanhahn Lol JVG an assistant coach for Jackson? He’s 10x more qualified for the job@KnickFilmSchool @NYPost_Berman @FisolaNYDN @IanBegley there's not a lot of wiggle room with @IanBegley's tweet.  I think not even interviewing him would be a huge mistake. especially since they seem to want someone the fans would connect with.@IanBegley That sounds like JVG, not Woodson@Schmeelk JVG seems to fit. What do you mean?@AnthonyMSG You know Jeff can inspire and lead men. You know he believes in accountability and defense. You know he’s tactically one of the best. You know he’s a lifelong learner because he hear him all time and he’s a regular at Sloan. If he wants the job he should get the job@DannyLeroux answer is to give lottery pts for losses up to "x" # games played, then give pts only for wins. "x" is determined randomly after season so there is no gaming it.  If you make "x" large enough, bad teams will still get better picks on avg. but everyone tries to win games with this@alanhahn rather than hiring someone off the Jeff Van Gundy tree, how about we just hire Jeff Van Gundy?@JonKnicksFan It’s just so dumb. If anything give That $ to KOQ, a guy who can play both sides of the ball@SBondyNYDN Can you please ask Perry some pointed questions like “do you think it’s a good idea to give a long term contract to a guy who can’t play in the playoffs”@steven_lebron @NewYorker oh geez, they can't possibly compare to Knicks fans.@ESPNNewYork @IanBegley Show any NBA player JVG rushing to "try" and break up the fight between Mourning and LJ, JVG trying to protect Camby from getting ejected, and they will know JVG's got their back. Defense first, holds stars accountable, understands NYC. BRING JVG BACK@Al_Iannazzone Heroic return by THJ and Kanter to destroy the tank@benjaminwittes @PreetBharara It’s not a perjury trap- it’s a truth trap. They’re worried about Trump telling the truth.@HPbasketball Hoiberg sat Markkanen for the entire 4th quarter of a close game the other night after he scored 24 points in 24 minutes. Certainly couldn’t have that messing up their tank. Instead it was Cam Payne time@ChrisIseman Hardest choice will be if Trae and Mikal are on the board. If it’s me I take Mikal.@DPLennon (But seriously he’s already better than post-2006ish Jeter)@DPLennon Oh Dave why do you do this to yourself. Say goodbye to your mentions@JonKnicksFan @IanBegley there is also the issue of Hornacek apparently not really getting along with several of the players - including KP, Noah, KOQ. Not sure if there is something about him that causes players to tune out when things aren't going well (like in PHX also)@TommyBeer Do you think he’ll get more than KOQ and which would you rather have?@zjdiluzio Ain’t gonna work at the next or with refs that see that stuff@bandwagonknick Yes but seriously. He could’ve fouled out already@bandwagonknick Don’t let me forget flopping@bandwagonknick Yeah if driving your shoulder into your defender’s stomach is “getting the most of your ability”@JonKnicksFan Literally every drive ends with him elbowing or shouldering guys to get space@zjdiluzio Brunson looks not so great too. He could and should get called for an offensive foul on just about every possessionhttps://t.co/Qhi23zseDN@TommyBeer so btw Trey Burke is the only player since at least 1946-47 to have played &gt;500 min in a season and average (per-36) 22p, 7a, ≤2 turnovers@BruceFeldmanCFB @si_ncaafb Someone should seriously ask Johnny why he thinks he has gotten 35 chances and why Kaepernick can’t get a workout@ByKimberleyA hilarious that Sean Parker, who pioneered mass-scale theft of intellectual property from musicians, is now feeling the guilt@Schmeelk in other words, those teams want him and are hoping he will drop to them after they poison the water a little@NYPost_Berman serious question - can you ask Jack (or others in NYK FO) about all the other drama around Mark Jackson (outlined here: https://t.co/W3RfFhq7uQ)@SBondyNYDN Give me JVG every day of the week@Schmeelk No way on Jackson. He might be an ok coach that looks worse now because Klay steph draymond all sort of hit their primes after he was let go, but all the weird locker room stuff and religious preaching seem a bad fit. Give me JVG back!@MitchellEpner @alanhahn My solution- from game 1 to game X losses are worth a lottery point. From game X to game 82 wins are worth a point. X is determined after the season and is some number between 60-82. Draft order is determined by accumulates the most points@MitchellEpner @alanhahn What happens when a team gets eliminated on the last day? Or wins or loses their only game after getting eliminated?@DannyLeroux Beasley@NateSilver538 i wonder what statistical method predicts that the Knicks, a team that has lost 17 out of their last 18 games, will somehow bounce back to win 5 out their last 13 games while starting and giving heavy minutes to Mudiay.@alanhahn In that case they have to give big minutes next year to the #tankcommander Mudiay@Schmeelk Perry should win exec of year if Mudiay tanks the Knicks into the top 6@TommyBeer @ianbegley Mudiay is really the stealth tank move of the season.  Already a -21.6 on/off net rating for NYK.  Mills/Perry are geniuses. Dude should play 36 min/game, and by all means we should continue starting Mudiay, Beasley, and Kanter together.@andrewsharp fun article re: tanking. One issue might be with NBPA pushing back against extra games? Anyway - major issue with tanking currently=losing is incentivized no matter how they flatten the lottery odds. Here's my idea for incentivizing WINNING - https://t.co/lR8cGlaafg@StevePopper Just imagine how many more gun sales that would be! The NRA is going to bring you on as a consultant@SBondyNYDN Any indication how much he would have to be willing to give back for NYK to agree?@ChinaJoeFlynn @JonKnicksFan Amare is prob still available?@IanBegley He shot 19/41 from 3 his first 5 games back@ChinaJoeFlynn This isn’t even stealth tanking anymore@ScooterToots body type and early struggles really bring this comp to mind: Lance Stephenson.@zjdiluzio Mudiay is huge too. His body is like Lance Stephenson who also figured out late how to use it.@NateDuncanNBA Not sure your point. Lots of teams play with 2 PGs@mattspendley Lol seriously though let’s see some Wendell Carter, Mikal and Miles Bridges. Seems more probable.@mattspendley Yeah showing clips of Trae Young and Doncic is just cruel. We’re the Knicks- we can’t even tank well@NYPost_Berman “We look forward to having another young athletic guard who can watch our 63 year old PG on a 1-year contract play all the minutes”@KnickFilmSchool Maybe that was to take Noah as well@ShamsCharania When ARE those Chinese Basketball Association playoffs again?@ChrisMannixYS @YahooSports note to all NBA GMs - Danny Ainge will only make a trade if he wins it hands down. Trade with him at your own risk.@StevePopper well, it's better than 2013 Dolan which was "trade everything for Bargnani"@OrtizDYST you tweeted IT after Kevin O'Connor but whatever@DanWoikeSports that 2019 talk was just for negotiating IMHO. Tell teams trying to fleece you that you're not worried about clearing Clarkson this year.@zjdiluzio at least we'll get to see how dreadful that starting lineup's defense will be without KP there to clean up the messes@AlbertBreer let's not forget that Clarkson and Nance were helping the Lakers win games, and 2018 Isaiah and Channing Frye...will not. And so the Celts get a better pick too.@NotoriousOHM not for Clarkson and Nance.@TheKnicksWall @gbnypat @knicksfilmroom eventually (ideally 2019-20) KP will be our starting center, and anyone  else we're considering (KOQ, Kanter, etc) will be our backup. Find me a  good, well-run team whose backup center makes more than MLE money and  whose FO feels good about that.@KnickFilmSchool would make zero sense to trade Dotson unless for a real upgrade. Young, cost-controlled, at a high-value position. Everyone else on that list should be shopped hard.@TommyBeer that said - of the top 15 2nd round picks in 2017, there are a lot of rotation players (and two stashes). And there's nothing saying they can't ALSO buy picks@DannyLeroux They should just run the Triangle again@JSports_ent Maybe they should be 🤔 about why smart teams are trying to trade for him and maybe just for once hold onto an young asset. They have him under team control for 2 more years. They should only trade him for an offer that blows them away@KnickFilmSchool Lol older, worse player, and not under team control after this year. How is that similar value?@KnickFilmSchool @IanBegley the Hornacek reaction is still weird though, but maybe unrelated@IanBegley Knicks blow out bad teams and get blown out by good teams. They're 15th in ORtg and 17th in DRtg. We have the 10th oldest roster. If this isn't the dreaded middle ground, I'm not sure what is.  Mills and Perry need to take step back to make a leap forward. SELL.@Herring_NBA @FiveThirtyEight your Knicks background makes you the perfect person to write this article 😂. This is a very Knicksy trade@Schmeelk if he shoots 0.42 from the field then that is 0.84 points per 2PFGA which is what Micah quoted. But he is not counting all the free throws (and turnovers). If he is averaging .27FTA per Post FGA and shoots 80% FT% and FT are 0.44poss then that adds ~.1 to his PPP = 0.95@Schmeelk Per https://t.co/tikc9gSZny KP has a FTR of about 27% on post-up possessions@Schmeelk He wrote 42% FG equates roughly to 0.85 PPP which it does, but and1s and shooting fouls/FTs are not counted in FG%@Schmeelk in general I agree w the analysis but he does leave out how often KP gets fouled in those 6” situations, so it might be better than it looks@StevePopper @northjersey I’d like a pony too please@daldridgetnt @RealDealBeal23 yikes why in the world would NYK trade Willy for a late 2nd rather than just keep him? &lt;5% chance that late 2nd is as good as him.@settern great HomePod review. Question - my wife and I share an AppleID so would that mean it would be connected to both our phones?@stevejones20 Only wish that Hornacek was as creative for Porzingis@TimBontemps I like where you're going with this, except I think they'd be better off trading JR+Osman +CLE 2018 1st to the Knicks for KOQuinn + Courtney Lee + 2018 CHI 2nd. Then start Hill/Lee/LBJ/Love/KOQ. Instantly better defense.@KnickFilmSchool i can't imagine Charlotte would sign up for that unless there is zero protection on the Knicks pick - esp since Kanter prob won't opt out@HickoryHigh @zjdiluzio feels very outlier-ish. he shoots only 42.7% on wide open jumpers (and only 35.3% on wide open jumpers if you exclude 3’s)@bencfalk Knicks fan here. 3man lineup of KP/Frank/THJ is +27.9, 122.1 O/94.1 D (195 poss). Why in the world have they ONLY played 195 poss together?@IanBegley per @cleantheglass lineup data, 3-man lineup Frank/THJ/KP=99th% in both ORtg (124.1) and DRtg (92.8).  Tell Jeff to play it more!@TommyBeer who says no - NYK sends Lee/KOQ to CLE for Frye/Shump/Calderon/CLE 2018 1st (#25). Saves Gilbert &gt;$10MM in lux tax too.@JonKnicksFan They’ve all gotten Courtney Lee disease. Shoot. The. Freaking. Three.@LockedOnKnicks @MMiranda613 Best episode you’ve done by far@EricPincus hmm ok 2+ years at 12.5+MM per for a below-average efficiency (53TS) high usage (USG27) guy who doesn’t play a lick of defense?@EricPincus you really think the Lakers would RECEIVE draft picks for Clarkson at that salary #?  Seems they would have to pay a team to take him.@TheKnicksWall @mattspendley If he can develop a 3-ball he can be a valuable player. The fact that he’s taken some in games prob means he’s been ok at them in practice@JonKnicksFan He’s miscast as a playmaker@NYPost_Berman And yet we will allow Jarrett Jack to get absolutely lit up by John Wall in the 1st and 3rd quarters@JonKnicksFan And when McDermott’s shot isn’t falling he gives nothing. They should give Dotson some run@KnickFilmSchool Where do you get this stuff? Really great@BR_DougFarrar countdown to him getting a cushy  7 figure consulting job with a firm who benefited greatly from his tax plan in 3…2…1..@KnickFilmSchool small lineup w KP at 5, Frank at PG is what we should see more of- 116 possessions, net rating +15.5, 83rd percentile offense, 97th% defense@Gibberman10 @ChinaJoeFlynn Mmm he could easily pass out of some of the super contested shots he takes. I’m not talking about his post ups over little guys.  What’s weird is that Hornacek clearly understands 3s&gt;2s yet they still only take 18 3PA/game@Gibberman10 @ChinaJoeFlynn KP is a huge culprit here. Takes tons of bad ugly shots@IanBegley @zjdiluzio over last 15g, we’ve also given up the MOST 3PA/g - borderline miracle that we’re somehow 5th in DRtg over that time. Not sustainable.@IanBegley @zjdiluzio over the last 15g, we’ve shot 18.3 3P/g, worst in league by far. Distance between NYK (#30) and #29 MIN is same as diff between #29 and #18.@IanBegley @zjdiluzio can someone ask Hornacek about the Knicks league-worst 3PA/g? Hard to win consistently in 2017 NBA shooting only 19 3P/game@jonfavs Dems would be very bad poker players. Always folding at the first sign of trouble rather than understanding how strong a hand we have@brianbeutler @jonfavs even if Hatch’s story is true— that means that Corker REALLY didn’t read either one if he thought it was airdropped into the conference bill@AlyssaRosenberg i was generally disappointed w Kylo Ren - more Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator than Longshanks from Braveheart, who was a much better villain@AlexKennedyNBA “and no, I’ll never come off the bench”@Diddy @Panthers Save your $ and buy the Knicks!@charliezegers Nice false equivalency.@RichCimini being totally serious- anyone think he might have a substance abuse problem? that many times late to any other job would raise that red flag@JCMacriNBA @KnickFilmSchool Would be interesting on offensive end but that group might never get a defensive rebound. Team really needs a 3/4 hybrid forward that can shoot and rebound. If Beasley could play defense he could fill that role@JonHeyman should just bring CC back and give Chance Adams a shot as the swing guy@HPbasketball What site did you use for this analysis? Nbawowy? Really nice@DeanO_Lytics interesting how defense has trended down at same time as offense has spiked@charliezegers and even so I would very much wager you have skipped ads on your DVR, which is also “stealing”@charliezegers agree with you on principle but the real failure is with the ads themselves. in TV they responded by making ads better/more entertaining@charliezegers meh that is not a good argument. if existing ads didn’t detract so much from the user experience, people wouldn’t need ad blockers@ChinaJoeFlynn that’s a great trade for the Yankees given the $ situation. Mitchell has been really underwhelming in majors@jaysonst really? I would think the Yankees would be ok just getting 3-4 years and then ejecting before the inevitable bad years at the end@JADubin5 Also the mistake wasn’t the 2004 trade. The mistake was reupping for another 10 years in 2007. If Stanton opts out in 2020 and the Yankees give him an additional 10 years, then the comp makes sense@JonKnicksFan amazing how open the paint is when KP is playing the 5.@JonKnicksFan And KOQ with the awful jumping close out on Portis that started that whole sequence@JonKnicksFan forget the Mets or Giants - the Knicks should get him@jonfavs When does whoever wins the special election actually become Senator? The next day?@davidaxelrod @HowardBeck @POTUS 🤔how “law &amp; order” POTUS/AG aren’t so “law &amp; order” when it comes to themselves and their cronies. Then it’s “see if you can let this go” 🤔@JonHeyman also-Giants’ twitter account tweeting out video of Eli’s emotional response to what is likely the end of NYG career is really bush-league 👎🏻@williamfleitch Next Eric Trump tweet is going to be “how can black actors  be be anti-slavery when movies about slavery have made a lot of $?!”@KnickFilmSchool @price_victory gonna be David Blatt if anyone@MikeGrunwald this 2018 midterm election will turn out to be the most important of my voting lifetime (I’m 43)@alanhahn Prob the clutch hitting stats- Altuve was awesome, judge not so much@TommyBeer and they did it in starter minutes over an entire season… expect Ntilikina to be atop this list by ASB@EricPincus could the Knicks do a similar thing with Noah as you’re suggesting the Lakers do with Deng?@KnickFilmSchool Jack seemed to be helping way off KK on at least a few. NYK have to be smart, know that passing to weakside corner 3 is LBJ’s preferred play@TommyBeer to be fair, most of the players on this list are terrible. but they don’t have player options@TommyBeer doesn’t really matter either way, but I wonder whether this was a favor to Kuz so he can get minutes elsewhere@JADubin5 nice job Jared! https://t.co/5lP0Dz53oV@tedlieu I don’t think it’s really called dating when a 32 year old man chases a 14 year old@DPLennon Great idea@KnickFilmSchool True but we have a unicorn 100% of the time and they have a unicorn zero percent of the time.@NateDuncanNBA Maybe Lance is the trick coin @bencfalk was talking about- teams will have to relearn how to guard him. He’s shot about 86% from the line on nearly 200 FTA since joining NYK also. He put in the work and it’s probably real.@JonKnicksFan good news is that there’s very little free agent $ out there to steal him away. but NYK may have to choose between KOQ and McD (Easy choice)@NateDuncanNBA love the pod, just correcting you re: Lance Thomas “struggles” w 3p shooting - he’s 94/228 (41%) in his career (and 80% FT)@JonKnicksFan Not going to happen at least until FO sees whether a playoff push is actually in the cards. KOQ too important@IanBegley @ramonashelburne so… how about Deng for Noah? Same contract. LAL with too many wings, NYK with too many centers…?@bencfalk great read - but given your Sixer 2014-16 pedigree, feels like a necessary follow-up = Porzingis vs. Okafor…@Gibberman10 And Collison is the type of PG I thought might give him problems- small jitterbug type. But man- Frank is like a freaking pterodactyl@KnickFilmSchool Play types@Gibberman10 His D has been ok but I’m most impressed with his passing. Legit secondary initiator now as opposed to just a chucker like in prev stint@AnthonyMSG Really amazing how solid the offense has been with so little point production from PG position@charliezegers Offensive game is much closer to Dirk (doesn’t have the off the dribble game)@McCannSportsLaw Will it be hard for NFL to argue for playoff susp if letter specific for reg season? not a substance abuse issue so is that policy relevant?@HowardBeck would be good to turn that non$ “values” statement around —&gt; take less $ so we can build a better team around you (like Giannis/Gobert)@NewEraKnicks @ChinaJoeFlynn He’s so valuable on a stealth tanking team@KnickFilmSchool Maybe switch assignments? Kanter on  Anderson and KP playing center? Or too much foul risk?@LockedOnKnicks @zjdiluzio it’s not just the increase in efficiency although that’s great of course — it’s that he’s increased his # of post-up poss by 240% also@jaysonst Wait I thought the balls were all slick so it was impossible to throw the ball past people@BR_DougFarrar Wtf are we talking about the civil war again?@SethWalder @msimonespn otherwise known as the worst place for a franchise to be@KnickFilmSchool Really great stuff. Hope this builds into even bigger things for you@DPLennon Precedent already set from Pillar. MLBPA argument would’ve been “no these games are more important than racism, don’t you get it?”@DPLennon Hmm that would’ve been a very interesting and very public appeal argument by MLBPA. He was on worldwide TV when he did it.@DPLennon At least a little of this is a calculation that the Asian fan base is not as likely to make a huge stink.@DPLennon Gotta disagree with you here Dave. If he had said the N word while making monkey faces I’m pretty sure he would be suspended this second.@charliezegers we are all on Hornacek to play him at the 5 but when he’s taking small 4s to school and Kanter/Willy are feasting on Oreb it’s hard to argue@JonKnicksFan I know “Ntilikina” is hard to spell but spelling it “Jack” is pretty weak@JonKnicksFan W. T. F.@ChinaJoeFlynn @seth_rosenthal @gbnypat early enough in the season that they could hire Blatt@DavidLaurilaQA @jaysonst @KaatJim @TylerKepner @KevinBruce83 hm this feels physically impossible unless the ball’s mass is actually different. I guess if MLBers generate different spin it is plausible@StevePopper yes but does he know the plays@JADubin5 @BenjySarlin Flake McCain Corker all great arguments for term limits. No one tells the truth or votes their conscience until theyre on the way out@KnickFilmSchool Is Bledsoe still good? Injury prone, defense has fallen off, although you never know if that’s just a bad situation@RothenbergESPN um no. Bledsoe has glass knees and is 27, due for contract in 2 seasons. Same win-now reasoning that always gets NYK in trouble.@MikeAScotto @netw3rk @BBallInsiders hey are supposed to follow up this tweet with “and Scott Perry laughed in their faces”. That you didn’t makes me nervous.@KnickFilmSchool We’re mostly complaining about not playing the young guys which Mills and Perry both said was going to be the plan this year@DPLennon Greg Bird solo homer. Book it.@JonKnicksFan feels like he’s trying to do the Budenholzer-THJ thing, except he’s playing Kanter and Sessions which disproves his own point@JonKnicksFan Hornacek clearly knows he’s on the hot seat and thinks playing Sessions Lance KOQ gives him the best chance. Wrong on multiple levels@KnickFilmSchool Baker and Ntilikina should play 90% if the PG minutes. Sessions is a known quantity and not in a good way@bdimenna If they actually were playing the kids it’d be fine. This serves no purpose other than the #tank@JADubin5 Just ridiculous. Hope the beat writers really push this@charliezegers Sessions is terrible. Should just play Ron and Frank and see if they can hang@knickerbacker 👍life gets in the way of basketball sometimes!@bballbreakdown Sweet long 2. Triangle special 😂@knickerbacker Haven’t seen you there in a while- need some of the old timers back!@knickerbacker Yup@BR_DougFarrar I hate Trump as much as anyone, but using soldiers’ deaths as political football is a bad look for media and democrats (and sportswriters)
