#welovelb #community #abcd https://t.co/H3SK7kRAQa@_jonb Thanks for sharing.@_jonb Can you share an example? I am interested in learning more. What part of UK are you in?We Love LB started with a sad realization that we had lived 25+ years on our childhood street and we didn‚Äôt know many of our neighbors. Can you relate?

#ABCD #welovelb@_jonb That‚Äôs fine. I think the main point is there needs to be a common thread of narrative on a block, neighborhood, city, or national level in order to share a common identity.

We are experimenting with these ideas on a Block level. What are you thinking about in your context?@_jonb From one of your own, Jonathan Sacks:

Freedom is the work of a nation, nations need identity, identity needs memory, and memory is encoded in the stories we tell. Without narrative, there is no memory, and without memory, we have no identity.
