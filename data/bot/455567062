@barbara_babcock With company 🤣 https://t.co/DiWemuwG0w@barbara_babcock Meant to share pic! https://t.co/17a8fZlFWH@barbara_babcock Well, you gotta have a sample run haven't you: seven-veg tagine and easy flatbread. All c/o #JamieOliver online recipes.
Motivation to cook and eat c/o good #NHS specialised care for #CVID gut.
#livingwithPI@barbara_babcock Happy #BankHoliday. Today I'll be cooking &amp; listening to audio of  #TheAlchemist 
I find it easier to invite friends for a meal by cooking what can be frozen in advance. Then I'm more confident that I'll be my best self on the day if its a fatigue/pain day

#livingwithPI, managing #autoimmune polyarthritis associated with #CVID 

Delighted I can now walk for an hour in 10min chunks. It hurts... it really hurts. Travelling alone gives me freedom to pace &amp; recover.
#BankHoliday 😁 https://t.co/TSutW3OSYo@MaxandMelia @theindigotree1 @IndishLondon @MAIDEN_UK @MoochEaling Very proud to play my part in #indepent #shoplocal #SmallBusiness . Good luck to all short-listed shopsOne for you if you're stuck in hot office. (It's better with the volume up). The weekend's coming! So pleased I could make it to
#mountephraimgardens https://t.co/3zquOzp4bhThis could make your day! #dancinghens https://t.co/liZjD3hHX8Vintage British seaside. #livingwithPI &amp; adjusting to 'new normal' when health challenges come is challenging: 'normals' keep changing; you have to take risks (How far can I now drive/walk with #CVID #polyarthritis). Setting personal goals both good &amp; terrifying at same time!  🤣 https://t.co/C3NGe6a5Ne@Andrew_F_Smith Oh and its not even #ThrowbackThursday yet, but am transported to a childhood of war movies *every* Sunday afternoon 😢😉@betabetic That sounds tough. I know it's devastating for me if, when I have an appointment with some of the few people that have some insight into my condition/treatment, there is no discussion of how *I* am (as opposed to 'OK thanks')/what I want to achieve.@BatstoneJC @Andrew_F_Smith Yes, I expect so 🤣#livingwithPI https://t.co/qHIQV60UbB@MrPnky85 @coffeespoonie Opened-up to my GP about the social isolation that comes with #chronicillness Response I got "well when I knew you as work colleague you only seemed interested in work". Ouch. Tried explaining impact on energy of #livingwithPI, but settled on "ah well".@MrPnky85 @coffeespoonie Yep! #livingwithPI #spoonieAnother astounding episode of #hospital. Not only in awe of the work done, but to see so many people from different nations working together: helping and supporting each other. We should be proud.Love how my #urbangarden dances on a blustery day https://t.co/BCShaQ0fldHumbled not only by the astounding work of the #ambulance crews featured on @BBC1 tonight but crucially their compassion for each other.@BoringEnormous We need this! 😀@betabetic I do hope your appointment is/was productive. Revolving round specialisms can be a common #ExpofCare for people #LTC (#multiplecomorbidity).  What would be the chances of proposing one intial teleconference between all to coordinate tests/knowledge/interpretation of results? https://t.co/zBmvlRsqVs@RoyalFreeNHS Thank you! #WorldPIWeek https://t.co/RdL3uCXlsQGreat to see a clinical service celebrating #WorldPIWeek and raising profile of specialised teams working with #PrimaryImmunodeficiency. After all, without them there woukd be no test-diagnose-treat. https://t.co/o4mP0wRBmII'd urge everyone to look at this report &amp; slides on improving patient experience: patients for confidence to give feedback; non-clinical staff to see how important they are &amp; clinical staff to reflect upon their role in bringing non-clinical staff  into their teamwork #ExpofCare https://t.co/pcBSoLkFjpEveryone makes a difference to #ExpofCare https://t.co/W7fQUPtsu5@yusuf_yousuf My #ExpofCare as a patient is that staff can also feel the tyrany of automated systems. They can see a problem that could be solved, but 'system says no' and do not believe they have authority to offer a pragmatic solution. Non-clin staff should have input to QI@careopinion Drawing upon prior life as clinician here! I think providing time &amp; support for non-clin staff to engage in reflective practice is probably crucial to enable staff to reflect, feel confident to play to their strengths and learn from feedback in a suportive setting #ExpofCare@jamesfm55 and sometimes you tell the person who asks! I've had excellent interactions with non-clincial staff who've opened with 'gosh you don't look good' &amp; opened converstaion &amp; others with clinical staff asking'How're you? &amp;  and saying 'good take a seat' before I've answered #ExpofCare@careopinion This hurt! (Physically 😀) but also as I was assumed to be inappropriatedly demanding beacuse I didn't look like the usual patient. whist I recognise that the receptionist was aiming to care for the needs of thise she assumed to be most needy #ExpofCare@careopinion An example, my primary condition is rare, but I developed an associated condition with referral to a service where most patients may be a lot older.  At reception, barely able to stand &amp; in severe pain I was tod to 'stand aside, some of our patients are frail you know' #ExpofCare@careopinion Interesting Q. As a patient, sometimes I do feel it might be useful for non-clinical staff to have a bit of background as to why I'm turning-up at their desk. whether this is via team meetings or another way, I don't know. #ExpofCare@SarahAshurst08 @careopinion Agree. I may come to consultation having prepared my issues &amp; questions, being focussed on what I need to get across. How I am 'received' by non-clinical staff can help me to stay calm &amp; focused or de-rail me completely as a patient leading to ineffective appointment #ExpofCare@yvonnesawbridge I have a cat with the same distressing disorder resulting in uncontrollable break-ins to the basement where the sack of prescription 'diet' food was stored. https://t.co/yqniRynIjM*Chimamanda* even#CityAdichie Thank you @AdichieSpeaks for being 'authentically Chimananda' https://t.co/ScD8IivOyALooking forward to a great conversation to start the weekend #CityAdichie https://t.co/JoRHnsoGup@TZtheIDFZebra Not to be confused, but they do confuse each other and treatment options. Clinicians supporting people with #primaryimmunodeficiency plus #autoimmune disease need to understand the conundruns created by their coexistence #PIawareness@Chris5anne @betabetic @CharlotteAugst @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu Giving-up &amp; struggling-on sometimes the only short-term option. Where drive for improvement really matters for many #LTC s is that there's no option of saying 'I won't have to deal with this once I'm better/had my op'. It's for life. We want support for life, not a life sentence@Chris5anne @betabetic @CharlotteAugst @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu My hunch &amp; experience is that there are service providers (not all) who have same passion - their time is also wasted/used ineffectively when pathways are uncoordinated or appointments are based on software rather than need. We need to harness like-minds with shared passion@Chris5anne @betabetic @CharlotteAugst @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu Exactly, and when that chasing involves getting a lot of 'system says no' responses it becomes emotionally exhausting too at a time when we need our resilience to self-manage and self-care let alone engage with the stuff that makes life meaningful@MightyDredd @betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @CEmPaC_Eu Very powerful analogy. I can only think that admin personnel would experience greater job satisfaction and connectedness with healthcare if they were enabled and supported to be more responsive to the needs of people #ExpOfCare@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu I'm with you there. Quality of life figures more highly than quantity for me too.@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu This is a real and common #ExpofCare I have no doubt that the intention to serve well is there, but much work is needed on culture and values to balance the very real demands on people so that they can deliver #compassioninhealthcare@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu You're not alone @betabetic I have experienced this too. Frequently IMO the driver is personnel responding to a billigerent automated system designed to process large volumes of people and not feeling/hearing the need of the person infront of them/on the phone@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu Indeed... and then if you mulitply that by a number of specialisms! I am more than grateful for the clinican who stepped up to the process of what they described as 'excavating' me from multiple specialisms and proactively modelling coordination.... https://t.co/1KbpfOIVw2@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu For me, the development of innovation in treatment across specialisms/disease groups and the development of coordinated models of care across specialisms need to go hand-in-hand #LTC #multimorbidity@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu Whilst my symptoms have become more complex since telling my story of uncoordinated care https://t.co/wVyD85oom5  My #ExpofCare has significantly improved through the determined efforts of clinicans to improve coordination and communication. #LTC #multimorbidity@betabetic @CharlotteAugst @Chris5anne @alf_collins @anyadei @MightyDredd @CEmPaC_Eu Very important point. For me my symptoms can be burdensome, however, uncoordinated appointments/treatment decisions, bureaucratic admin and kit-chasing can break my ability and sap my energy to self-manage this burden. #LTC #multimorbidity@MichaelaTait8 @MKHospital Sounds really interesting. Look forward to hearing/learning more.@LucyAlexandria Genuinely lovely.@janey513 Nice 😊@gregecky @BoringEnormous Looks like you've been 'Trumped'.

In climate where it's entirely understandable for default response to be 'but we don't have the time/staff' in converstaions about improving #patientexperience, it's empowering for all to think 'so what CAN we do?' https://t.co/4NyllOTccz@AlexYLDiabetes @AndFiona @BMJPatientEd @janey513 @GleefulKaz @KathEvans2 Absolutely! I like the terminology of 'bright spots and landmines'. Keeping data long term has enabled me to either spot these or at least identify lines of enquiry and to articulate these more clearly, with examples, to clinical members of the teamThis matters #makinghealthcarehuman https://t.co/UmyXeXN3dD@BoringEnormous Bit worried about what that toy is though! 😂An accurate real life experience of #Raredisease in a Hollywood film... and it's funny, in spite of the complexity of diagnosis, impact on life and love... and not discovering an underlying #primaryimmuodeficiency #CVID until after the wrap. https://t.co/mOfnCWE2Xu@barbara_babcock Being a 'Warrior' doesn't suit me, possibly even harms me: it doesn't feel authentic to what I am facing. Fighting my #CVID #primaryimmunodeficiency #polyarthritis uses energy that I need to get the best out of the day...however I am today and whatever I can do today #PIAwareness https://t.co/lw8wvOFA27@LyndamHolt @janey513 @drunacoales or a suitably trained and qualified Allied Health Professional.  I want the team around the person: assembling the team based on who has the right skills, in the right place, at the right time centred around the objectives of my care and treatment #raredisease #chronicillness@cyberjennifer @BMJPatientEd Me neither.

Can @careopinion offer this?@anyadei @Pam007Nelmes @flippper1 @PPISolutions @my_PPG @amirhannan @ingridbrindle @HelenRCGP @cyberjennifer @MightyDredd @careopinion Yes, as a patient, I very much value @careopinion when it results in an open and meaningful response from the service rather than the equivalent of a standard letter@flippper1 @anyadei @PPISolutions @my_PPG @amirhannan @ingridbrindle @HelenRCGP @cyberjennifer @MightyDredd Agree.

Free text questions &amp; regular feedback of thematic analysis of such would make me more inclined to complete@BMJPatientEd Yes, and can help to ensure that number of appointments attended also equals number of appointments with effective outcomes.@andersot91 You too!@anyadei @ProfRecordSB Yes, a great addition, from my perspective,  would be a set of standards on recording and communicating the patient's own personal health and quality of life objectives with a section for including them@abrewi3010 Good point. Support/info for my primary diagnosis #primaryimmunodeficiency #PIAwareness is good on research &amp; immunoglobulin, but found most help for gut symptoms on #IBD #Chrones sites; how to eat with nausea on #cancer sites &amp; management of joints on #RA sites #CreakyChats@globetrotteri @limberation @CreakyJoints Haha! Yes, the reality if three days pain'free is that I'd most likely do all those admin of life tasks that I need to do to get in the best place to cope with the pain to come (laundry, shopping, batch-cooking, recycling) gotta free myself of the 'must-do's' #CreakyChats@Dividivigirl Oh yes, the jumping out of bed into the shower! That's a best day event #CreakyChats@LCalabreseDO @CreakyJoints Crucial! As is coordination between specialists if you have multiple conditions. Pleased to say my immunologist and rheumatologist about to start joint clinic appointments #primaryimmunodeficiency #CVID #polyarthritis #CreakyChats@buttahflyk @RoyalCaribbean Nice! #CreakyChats@limberation @neimhaille @CreakyJoints So I'm not so wierd then!

You know how it goes! 😅 #CreakyChats@TerezHumphrey @CreakyJoints Excellent! #scooterheels #CreakyChats@rbouchard007 @CreakyJoints I'm adjusting to regularity of flares, and remain optimistic that better medical management may come. There's complexity balancing treatment for my #autoimmune #polyarthritis &amp; my #primaryimmunodeficiency However optimism can feel punishing each time hopes are dashed #CreakyChats@TerezHumphrey @CreakyJoints Think you should wear your great heels on the scooter! 😊 Could you? Or is thst just not possible? #CreakyChats@neimhaille @CreakyJoints I get this. City life is challenging if pacing and taking each day as it comes is a necessity. Pacing is difficult in a setting where no one else does it and taking each day as it comes is difficult if the only way to socialise is to book in advance. #CreakyChats@CreakyJoints On bad day: Remeber those who said they'd help but didn't; mourn loss of friends, career, financial security; worry about what it'll be like as I age as an isolated person; wonder how I'll afford care that could help; wonder how many years I'll have to endure it #CreakyChats@CreakyJoints On a good day: Be brave enough to ask for help; let my 'must-do's' slip again; settle with a distraction (film/sleep/cooking if i can manage it); reach out to medical team for advice on whether any tweeks to regime will help. try to see it as 'just one day' #CreakyChats@MayaHoensJoshi Doesn't seem superficial. It matters #CreakyChats #Chronicillness@heidi_paterson @CreakyJoints It's taken me a long time to find my pace. Now that I'm getting a sense of it I'm working out how to pace when the world does not pace with you and how to stay financially viable. Lots to learn #CreakyChats@TerezHumphrey Haha!
