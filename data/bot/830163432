It's my #Twitterversary! I have been on Twitter for 5 years (since 18 Sep 2012).
And you? https://t.co/fEH9hzqzQQIt's my #Twitterversary! I have been on Twitter for 4 years (since 18 Sep 2012).
And you? https://t.co/fEH9hzqzQQ@Noatak1 say or confess to me, now's the time to do it. If you don't…you can just leave and never set foot on my doorstep again."*@Noatak1 And I wouldn't care so much, if I wasn't so in love with you. Which unfortunately, I am. Now if there's anything else you want to -@Noatak1 did not only to me, but to Shia and the rest of our entire battalion, Noatak." His words are firm. "…all you've ever done is lie. -@Noatak1 my son to it. To keep your affair with him private from me for all these years. To lay in the same bed as him /knowing/ what he -@Noatak1 "I don't care what he did to me. I expected him to make my life a nightmare. What I didn't expect, Noatak, was for you to expose -@Noatak1 *His eyes are expressionless to you. His beautiful bi-colored eyes. The blue one now has scars surrounding it from the gunshot. -@Noatak1 to." He turns to go into the house. "By the way. My surgery is this week. And your brother is taking me."*@Noatak1 my son…you're gone. You're gone, Noatak. And you can go run off happily and do whatever it is you do when I'm telling you not -@Noatak1 And not even /one/ fucking moment could you listen to me." He turns his head away. "…if I see /anything/ even remotely wrong with -@Noatak1 After I've been letting him do work for you for /months/ now!!" He's so pissed. "…you know how fragile he is. How unstable he is. -@Noatak1 "You just…blatantly did exactly what I told you /not/ to do! I know exactly what you two were doing. And I can't…even believe. -@Noatak1 *He keeps his eyes narrowed onto you. "…tell me how I could be okay. How, Noatak." He reaches up a hand to feel his bandaging. -@Noatak1 you've done. "……" he taps his foot*@Noatak1 outside alone. He folds his massive arms across his chest. "………" he's waiting for you to say something. Anything to justify what -@Noatak1 He barely even looks at you. Taga hugs him tight, and then he disappears inside. Hando shuts the door, leaving the two of you -@Noatak1 door. He stares down to both of you, smiling the best he can. Deep down, you know he's /really/ unhappy. "Hey guys! Welcome back!"-@Noatak1 *He forces a smile. "I hope Tarrlok won't miss me too much!" As the two of you make your way to the apartment, Hando opens the -@Noatak1 the closeness so he doesn't have to be left alone to himself. His thoughts are probably in a really dark place. "……"*@Noatak1 whole thing with Risu. That's probably why he's clinging to you like this. You're the only one he can truly come to. He's craving -@Noatak1 just tell me if you think I'm insane, or something…" you can feel his heart rate picking up. He's probably still fired up from the-@Noatak1 probably freaking out that I'm not there. Hhh." He balls his hands into fists under his chin. "…what's wrong with me…really…like -@Noatak1 *He nods. "……" he suddenly starts to sniffle. "…how could I even face my dad after this shit…" he shakes his head. "…he's -@Noatak1 What even is 'right' anymore? "…sorry. I don't know what I'm saying. I sound stupid…"*@Noatak1 it…changes…anything." Your mind drifts back to his pleasure-filled moans. You'd love to hear that again. But would it be right? -@Noatak1 little. "…I wanted it. And I want it again and again…heh." He curls himself tighter. "…it's just…to release tension…I don't think-@Noatak1 *He takes a deep slow breath through his nose. "…it's okay…" you don't know what he's thinking. But you feel his heart pick up a -@Noatak1 come between yours. "…is this…too much for you?" His voice is groggy.*@Noatak1 *He hesitates, but decides to lean his head against your chest. "….…" his eyes flutter. "……" he bends his knees, letting his legs -@Noatak1 His eyes fall away from you. "……" he nuzzles closer. "…you asked me if I was okay. But you don't seem that great at the moment."*@Noatak1 *He curls up under the covers, bringing himself closer to you. He frowns, watching you. "…I don't want to go to prison for this." -@Noatak1 police gonna find us…or…find the house…" he seems totally unfazed by what you just did.*@Noatak1 *He nods, adjusting his grip. You end up carrying him to the bedroom, and the two of you get dressed. He watches you. "…are the -@Noatak1 age.*@Noatak1 drowsy, from all that euphoria. And doesn't seem to be complaining. But he's just a kid. A 17 year old kid. And you're twice his -@Noatak1 all over the both of you. Should you have stopped? Why did you continue. "…don't let go of me…" he shuts his eyes. He seems -@Noatak1 *His heart pounds so hard. He nods against your neck, hardly able to speak. "…mmhm…yeah…" he clings to you tightly. The fluids are-@Noatak1 against your neck, his arms locked around you so tightly "……"*@Noatak1 thrusting into you as he does. His bare member slides on top of yours unexpectedly, making you shiver. "…hhh…" he breathes hard -@Noatak1 *His moans slowly become loud whimpers. Involuntarily, he thrusts ever so slightly into your hand. "…huuuh…huuh…" he releases, -@Noatak1 His heart is pounding against yours. He nuzzles himself further into your neck, continuing to moan. You love the sound.*@Noatak1 your neck. He doesn't seem to know how to reciprocate. His arms tighten their grip around your neck as he submits to you. "…nhhh…"-@Noatak1 *He breathes even faster, his jaw opening. His louder, squeaky moans go straight to your ear, his nose nuzzled in the crook of -@Noatak1 relaxes against you. Eagerly, he pushes his bulge against you further, and another soft moan follows. "……"*@Noatak1 high-pitched moan. He leans himself against your shoulder again, his breath hitting your neck faster. He shuts his eyes and -@Noatak1 *His face is bright red. He struggles to meet your eyes, looking down to your bulges. At you push in, he lets out a small, -@Noatak1 steady, his warm breaths hit your neck as he starts to calm down. Unexpectedly, you feel him become hard in the embrace. "……hh…"*@Noatak1 you, and then wraps his arms around your neck. Your barely clothed bodies touch in places that seem too intimate. Slow and -@Noatak1 is finally calmer. He huffs hard, then wipes his eyes. "……" his piercing icy eyes lock with yours. "……" he slowly steps over to -@Noatak1 punches at the wall. His knuckles become bloodied, adding to the bruising that you already gave his wrists. Minutes pass, until he-@Noatak1 *He breathes in deep through his nose, his small body trembling. A low scream comes out of him, and he starts throwing quick -@Noatak1 are wedged uncomfortably in his crotch area as he holds them up. He looks away. "…whatever…"*@Noatak1 "…I really just…feel like crying and screaming and breaking shit, to be honest." He forces an uncomfortable chuckle. The briefs -@Noatak1 …but that's really the worst question to ask me right now…" he frowns. The briefs are really loose. He holds them to keep them up.-@Noatak1 *he watches you dress, pouting. He quickly pulls up his own briefs, dropping the towel simultaneously. "No offense uncle Noatak…-@Noatak1 shape. Still pretty slim…but he has a little more meat on his bones. He shivers, frowning. "…I can't believe all of this…"*@Noatak1 you hear the water run. You both quickly finish, and Taga steps out with a towel around his waist. He looks like he's in very good-@Noatak1 *He nods, pouting. "……" he seems scared. He probably thinks the police are going to get him. "……" he goes to the shower, and soon -@Noatak1 me this?!"*@Noatak1 you do?" You notice Taga has specks of blood on his face and clothing. You're pretty much covered in it. "…why…why are you giving -@Noatak1 no way…" he studies the keys in his hand "……fucking hell, uncle Noatak…does my dad know about all of this money you make? And what-@Noatak1 *With his help, you enter the vast, desolate mansion. It's very cabin-like. Taga speaks breathlessly. "…what the fuck…this…there's-@Noatak1 at all regret doing that." His voice shakes. He looks queasy. "…where…where are we going?"*@Noatak1 heard him threatening you…and…I saw the gun…I wasn't going to let anything happen to you. Punish me if you want, but…I don't…-@Noatak1 *He stares at the burning home in disbelief. His face is still pale. "…I'm doing…okay…" he hesitates to look at you. "…look I-…I -@Noatak1 you can think of, worth thousands of dollars. there is also a tiny folded up piece of paper. You can still hear your car rumbling.*@Noatak1 dilate in his head. He's so far gone. You go to empty his pockets, seeing what he has. He has packet after packed of every drug -@Noatak1 shared a bond that was even closer to you and Hando's. As you stare at his corpse, you see that his robotic eyes twitch and -@Noatak1 Eventually, you hear the car start outside. Your heart feels broken by this. You thought you were in love with him. You and Risu -@Noatak1 *He takes a second, still focused on Risu's blank expression. "……" Taga then bolts for the door, taking your keys along the way. /@Noatak1 by the sight. "……"*@Noatak1 know how to feel from the shock. "……" bits of Risu are sprayed almost everywhere. It was an explosive mess. Taga looks traumatized-@Noatak1 fast. His first kill. You remember how it felt for you. He isn't even 18 yet, and he just murdered Risu. So suddenly. You don't -@Noatak1 strange heap on the floor. Taga's eyes don't leave the body. You can feel his adrenaline pumping, his heart racing so dangerously -@Noatak1 *Taga's face is so ghostly white. You taste copper in your mouth from the spray. You're covered in it. Risu collapsed into a -@Noatak1 catch your breath. You suddenly turn around, and see Taga standing in front of the bedroom door, huffing. "………"*@Noatak1 the wall and ceiling. And Risu, now missing most of the top of his head, collapses lifelessly. You are in shock. You can't -@Noatak1 going to…" suddenly, his gun hand jerks up, the pistol pressing itself under his jaw. BAM. A flash of white. Red sprays all over -@Noatak1 becomes stone cold and serious. Like a switch flipped. "…I have to kill you. Then I'll find Taga in here, and kill him. Then, I'm -@Noatak1 huffs for a breath. "…all I've ever wanted was you…no one else…no one else…" he chokes out a single sob. His expression suddenly -@Noatak1 *His face scrunches up. How it always did when he cried. Except tears don't fall. It just puts him through excruciating pain. He -@Noatak1 tone is very off. Very psycho.*@Noatak1 wild.

"…and don't think I've -@Noatak1 *Risu laughs, snorting. "…it was just to keep me at your side. You just…wanted me to believe that you CARED. But /come ON/…" he -@Noatak1 shake erratically. Like he isn't in control of them. "…be honest with me. Right now."*@Noatak1 that for…all these years!! All these years, you've just…used me…for your…selfish little fantasies!'" His robotic pupils twitch and-@Noatak1 raises a brow at you. "…you need to tell me right now…if all of this…was a game to you. Because I think now…I'm starting to think -@Noatak1 seat at your small dining table. The pistol is held in his hand so that the muzzle peeks over the table. "…sit." You comply.

He looks awful, despite being dressed up. He looks like he's been on some heavy -@Noatak1 slicked back in his bleach blonde ponytail. The robotic pupils of his eyes focus on you, and he raises to point a gun in your -@Noatak1 the door knocks. Loud, impatient knocks. Then, the door flies open. Risu, dressed handsomely in a suit, barges in. His hair is -@Noatak1 *He nods, pouting. "…I'll go under the bed…" he races back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a few minutes of anticipation,-@Noatak1 shocked. "…what are we gonna do? I can't believe this is happening so soon…" he runs his fingers through his hair*@Noatak1 His voice is mocking. "…I'm gonna be there in five minutes." The line hangs up. Taga races out from the other room. "……!" He's -@Noatak1 with all this marriage and family bullshit. And you'll /never/ change the world as we know it if you're focused on…on /family/…!" -@Noatak1 *He sounds erratic. Strung out. "Shut the fuck up!! Fuck that son of a bitch!! You're mine. No one else's. He's distracting you -@Noatak1 You don't even have to question who it is. Taga's eyes widen. He suddenly looks very angry. "……"*@Noatak1 can stop trying to train my kid…I get it. I know what you're planning. Can we meet somewhere private…and just…talk about this!?!" -@Noatak1 *You hear a sigh. "………" it's quiet for a long while. "I know you're looking for me.

And I feel like…I feel like a better person because of it…" he rubs his wrist, where a subtle bruising forms.-@Noatak1 *He nods, seeming very sure. "…I really do. I understand why you did it. Why you've been treating me like this. You have to do -@Noatak1 to get him tonight. I want to help you destroy him."*@Noatak1 happened. I'll do whatever you tell me from now on.

My dad told me.I shouldn'tve…I just…I deserve a lot worse, for saying-@Noatak1 *He nods, wrapping his arms around you. He's so forgiving. Even though you almost destroyed him. Destroyed his life. He leans -@Noatak1 from his nostrils. He slowly rises, coming over to you. He sits beside you. "…please forgive me…please…" he sobs into his hands*@Noatak1 *He trembles hard, his face slick with tears. He shakes his head. "…I'm so so so sorry…I shouldn'tve said that…!!" Snot pours down-@Noatak1 seizure-like motions. "……!!!!" This poor kid. He's had it rough enough already.And he didn't mean what he said. He was just upset.*@Noatak1 getting on the floor beside it and curling up into a ball.He sobs heart-achingly into his knees. His small body trembles in quick,-@Noatak1 *He cries hard. Sobs. He sounds absolutely terrified. You see yourself in him. How you felt those nights. He gets off the bed, -@Noatak1 the edge. "…AAAAHHHHH!!"*@Noatak1 DOING!? STOP!!!!!!!!" He screams even louder, trying to push against you. All you want is for him to shut up. He pushed you over -@Noatak1 *Taga screams at the top of his lungs, trying to fight you. He kicks and thrusts his legs out helplessly. "STOOOOP!! WHAT ARE YOU -@Noatak1 your dad ass-fucked you?" He scrunches his nose, still looking away. "……"*@Noatak1 *He doesn't look at you, keeping his arms folded across his chest. "……" he replies in a snarky voice. "…did you like it when -@Noatak1 When you get to your home, he exits the car quickly, going in ahead of you. He angrily sits on the couch.

I could go there and ask around. -@Noatak1 *He pouts. "……" Taga narrows his eyes. "…I know you're pissed and all…but you need to calm the fuck down." He shakes his head. "…-@Noatak1 a phone number, and I'll call him. I'll bring him wherever you want him." He tightens his brows.*@Noatak1 "…you at least need to let me watch.That's all I'm asking. Otherwise,I'm not helping you anymore…" he scrunches his nose. "…get me-@Noatak1 *He looks to where you grab his arm. "……" his eyes are angry. "…I can handle more than you…/think/." He yanks his arm away. "……" -@Noatak1 done." He frowns. "…I don't know…maybe I should kill someone for real…see if I can really do it." He looks to you.

Now. Prove that he has what it takes to gain full control of someone. Make them do whatever you -@Noatak1 *He frowns. "…uncle Noatak…that's…asking a lot."
