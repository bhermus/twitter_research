A film by Soumodeep Ghosh Chowdhury

These photographs were taken by @SoumodeepGC himself. https://t.co/N6Jy6E4SdSOnce you decide to inject love into your soul, you become rich.
There is nothing called a failure in love. 
It's just the comprehension of humanity and it's clauses.
Let me not fall in love with you.
Let me fall in love with the smiles of the world.

Happy Valentine's Day https://t.co/Q8l1swG1xz@paulocoelho is always right. https://t.co/YGPrDASBNhLet's not fall in love this Valentine's Day.
