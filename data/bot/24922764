Was Stormy paid based on a liability while hired to jump out of a cake at Trump property opening event? 
I would bet the truth is that silly.  She's all about Play for Pay deals, cold never make an honest living. 
#Ingrahamangle #hannity@AP4Liberty Just watched your interview with Glenn Beck 2016. Clearly you support open boarders and against Trump at that time, a former Libertarian, yet now GOP. 
I'm confused...
@HennessySTLGood for you @KevinJacksonTBS ... You make Missouri proud!  #ingrahamangleThis belong's to you @clairecmc ... 
#MoSen https://t.co/ozUcehV50JNeed Exec. Order from @EricGreitens for lifetime ban on some lobbying, 5-years for others. @HennessySTL "All five are in line for lobbying jobs or “government relations” work with corporations that live on tax credits and other government handouts" https://t.co/coRQVw9Qs2 #moleg@clairecmc In addition to supporting #IranDeal secret nuclear weapons this bluewave is yours, too.
Hey, too bad Todd Akin isn't running this year. No smooth sailing here.
#MOSen #moleg https://t.co/udfl1x1Q3p#IranDeal had "planned intigration of nuclear warheads into ICBMs".   
And you knew @clairecmc !!! You are truly a danger to US National Security! 
#MOSen #moleg
#Hannity@thehill Look @clairecmc There's your Iran buddy accusing @POTUS of violating the #IranDeal ... How fitting for @TheDemocrats talking points this election season @CNN 
Good luck that!
#MOSen #moleg@clairecmc knew Iran intended to nuke Israel + ......., yet she supported it anyway. 
Let that truth sink in no matter your party affiliation.
Unbelievable!        
#Mosen #moleg #IranDeal 
#hannity  @marklevinshow https://t.co/Q5hpOA6bxI@netanyahu Wow, that was one bold and brave Intel operation getting those documents. 
#HannityKnowing now what Americans learned today from @netanyahu   you @clairecmc supported the #IranDeal .. Who do you think you are playing with people's lives like this? Thought we would never know truth? #MOSEN https://t.co/6RPWcJMLpPLittle to no coverage on local news. How fitting for you @LydaKrewson @KMOV @FOX2now
#BallparkVillageCertainly not safe to go downtown to @Cardinals games anymore, not when violence and riots prevail over Law.
Democrats have destroyed STL...
@LydaKrewson https://t.co/lmpwHKdgjmSame room where George Washington held his first small private inaugural.  Was there a year ago, remember it as if it was yesterday. Mount Vernon is private funded, no government support. https://t.co/cAIE0wEi2DThis won't go over well with the rats. :-) https://t.co/XIpYBrv7q4I would buy @Comey book for .25 cents then use it to start a campfire. 
#Hannity@HennessySTL Thanks for your post, read it. Operatives quietly plan to collectivize on filling pockets. Reminds me of China-hub but on steroids. Last I checked MO is not the United Nations.@HennessySTL @robschaaf Just the term "Clean Missouri" screams radical Alinsky Chicago style propaganda. Obama would be proud.@J_Hancock @AGJoshHawley @EricGreitens Well tweedledee! Waiting for @AGJoshHawley to look into Claire's FEC records.

#hannity #IngrahamAngle https://t.co/qkcgQv1N7tI think it's time @PressSec file Order of Protection against @Acosta He's becoming scary. There is no rationale, there.
Concerned he may harm someone @whpressscorps 
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS Someone do something.
#Hannity #IngrahamangleRecommend @Acosta take a step back and find perspective, or seek psychological assistance. I hear no reasonable rationale, there. Potentially dangerous, I would leave the room for protection. @CNN  
#HannityFix is, don't allow people to control what public establishment you choose to eat or drink at while dressed in proper attire.

Need to look at unusual behaviors in FEC records Oct. Nov. Dec. through Org. NGO or law firm out of state.Did @HawleyMO not know Watkins is a high level crooked left lobbyist? Did he not have judgement enough to not involve himself in this case with nasty Watkins, Gardner, and McCaskill in hiding? When will the GOP learn they fall all on their own. 
#molegAnyone notice the name 'Rudy' was kept quiet in #fakenews today?  
One word; Fear...
#hannityOften think of the normal hard working folks at the @FBI 
Can't imagine what it takes to get through the day under current conditions.  
#hannityBankrupt @TheDemocrats spending money on loan for a fake law suit, so that means the #Hannity paid trolls won't get paid. 
Too funny!@politico @politico Cool it with the #fakenews Otherwise the taxpayers will file suit against you for wasted cost of #MuellerInvestigation expense. We will not pay!
Rudy is the end of the nonsense.@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Please send the #MuellerTime invoice to all #FakeNews outlets; @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBC @NPR etc.  We the Taxpayers should not be stuck paying for this nonsense...no way!  
#ComeyMemos @FBI @TheJusticeDept @seanhannity @FoxNewsWe're well past done with this hoax! Taxpayers should not be stuck with #ComeyMemos #Mueller bill for this investigation. 
Send the invoice to; @CNN @MSNBC @NBC @ABC

@FoxNews @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson https://t.co/T7ACeFxJ3kHow's the #ComeyMemo working out for you? @clairecmc 
#MOSEN not happy you're purposely delaying the Pompeo confirmation, urgent re: NK. Not too smart.  Missouri voters never forget.
@DevinNunes@DevinNunes Hold @TheDemocrats @clairecmc #MOSEN in Contempt of Congress for delay on #Pompeo confirmation. That should stop their delay games. After all, it is an election year.
#IngrahamAngle #Hannity @FoxNews@CNN should get the invoice for #MuellerTime on this phoney #FakeNews Russian collusion investigation. 
NOT THE TAXPAYERS!!

His name is Rudy.

So, suck it up!  @clairecmc #syria
#IngrahamAngle @FoxNewsTrump: "The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people."

#HannityNo @seanhannity It's about Ukraine steel exec who donated $130,000 to Trump Foundation, not Stormy CNN filth. No mention of Clinton receiving $29 Mill, from same dude, no raid yet... Still pending. 
What a sick Justice system we have! 
#HannityGet the number correct, @seanhannity #Ukraine 
Clinton donation was $29 Million, Cohen is $130,000 donation to Trump Foundation.  But no Clinton raid? @FBI 
#Mueller is a frickin idiot! He should be ashamed. @FBI
#Hannity@ReaganBattalion @benshapiro Correction, $29 Million...  Mueller is spending millions on low 6-figures.  Where is the Clinton raid?@FBI playing games... Then we US Taxpayers need 3-years to file our taxes. https://t.co/4Tk7yGNglr@JonahNRO Where is the $29 million dollar Clinton Foundation raid with the same Ukraine dude?  
Mueller would rather spend millions taxpayer dollars on 6-figures?  No logic, extreme and unreasonable actions. Doesn't look good for FBI. 
#Hannity #IngrahamAngle@Judgenap Excellent explanation on #MichaelCohen FBI raid, but what you said applies only when the process is applied under Law.  FBI doesn't believe in Law, nor do they follow the Law. We know they get Warrants based on lies.   @TheJusticeDept

#McCabefired
