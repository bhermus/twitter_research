Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." - @ZackSnyder (via THR) https://t.co/vNVlnVn39r“It goes back to what I’ve said about Superman and making him really understandable for today...That applies to Lois as well. She has to be in the same universe as him.” -Zack Snyder https://t.co/e8O0jbXxyjAlso, Zack Snyder said back in March 2011 that Amy’s role as Lois Lane (in #ManOfSteel) was “a linchpin” to the project and will have contemporary appeal and spirit. https://t.co/7bRl7LYJJE“There was a big, giant search for LOIS. For us it was a big thing and obviously a really important role. We did a lot of auditioning but we had this meeting w/ #AmyAdams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it.”- @ZackSnyder (on casting Amy as #LoisLane in #ManOfSteel) https://t.co/IiMgBcEmxE#TBT Amy Adams as LOIS LANE 📝🌐 in #ManOfSteel (2013) 🎞 film...
