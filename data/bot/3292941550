UNEP Executive Director's @ErikSolheim's thoughts on possible solutions: https://t.co/3VdFqDwp4v @SustainableLSECould we strengthen #democracy by making it more representative, or should we offer more opportunities for direct decision-making? Paul Wiggins argues that referendums can be problematic; do you agree? You can share your ideas at https://t.co/HeJoBPfqAR https://t.co/nJbQoCNb30This week’s vegan cake as part of our #LSE100goesVeggie Green Impact pledge is a delicious chocolate cake made by @JBTempleton and decorated by two very enthusiastic 11 year old helpers! @SustainableLSE https://t.co/vXCTbLszt5Calling all LSE educators!

Gidron and Hall analyse the importance of social status, recognition and respect to functional democratic societies. #sociology #politicalcommunication https://t.co/8sQSI54CqyOn big data and #democracy from @RanaForoohar: "The ability of a range of companies...to personalise almost every kind of product and service based on data streams is not just a business model shift. It is a fundamental challenge to liberal democracy." https://t.co/BlhS3Oh8RDLSE100 students thinking about the role of social media in #democracy, check out this @fbnewsroom blog post from @CassSunstein on why despite their flaws, platforms like Facebook still have significant benefits for democracies. https://t.co/EfNpdhEscuNext Wednesday, @GenBrexit is hosting an event for #LSE100 students on the youth vote and #Brexit! Come along to the panel discussion, where leading experts will discuss their latest research on the complex relationships between young people, Brexit, and democracy. See you there! https://t.co/nHkYewnbJ7LSE100 students focusing on 'fake news' for the group projects may want to check out this story of a tech solution that hasn't quite worked according to plan: Google suspends fact-checking feature over quality concerns https://t.co/KWbt4BI77v #democracy@Doucas_C Thanks for asking, @Doucas_C. LSE100 is currently run just for undergrads, but if there is interest from others, perhaps this is something that could be developed for the future!@brianklaas @LSEGovernment @LSEnews @HurstPublishers And be sure to read the brand new book from today's speaker @brianklaas, The Despot's Apprentice: Donald Trump's Attack on Democracy. It's available to borrow from @LSELibrary or you can buy your own copy from @HurstPublishers here: https://t.co/TFKZZ7WuoS #LSE100LiveAnd that's a wrap on today's #LSE100Live with @brianklaas! Thanks so much to everyone who joined us for a timely and thought-provoking talk on #democracy in the age of Trump. A video of today's event will be available on our Moodle page shortly! #partofLSE https://t.co/5lEqr9IM9S.@brianklaas on a key political science lesson: this next US election is about strengthening of the democratic process, not about the purity of a single person's policies #LSE100LiveIn his talk at #LSE100Live, @brianklaas uses the analogy of #democracy as a sandcastle - it takes a long time to build and perfect, but can be slowly eroded away by waves of authoritarian-like moves, statements, and tweets. https://t.co/fHX1JtAVhV.@brianklaas: Trump's foreign policy and his endorsement of authoritarian and dictatorial regimes around the world is "creating the perfect storm against democracy globally" #LSE100LiveOn Trump's corporate interests, @brianklaas argues that in a #democracy, you should never have to face the question of whether the president is doing something because it's right for the country, or to enrich himself. #LSE100Live.@brianklaas highlights the importance of free press in #democracy: Trump has called the press the 'enemy of the people', and if you look where that term has been used before, you have to look at authoritarian regimes #LSE100Live https://t.co/dg70Jiu3SQ"Political scientists would argue...it's hard to say the President of the United States is a liar - but with Trump, it's impossible to refute that statement" - @brianklaas on the significance of presidential lying #LSE100Live.@brianklaas on The Despot's Apprentice: "Trump supporters would strongly disagree with me, but I think everything I say in the book is non-partisan, or at least non-partisan in 2015." #LSE100LiveOur first #LSE100Live event is officially underway! Dr @brianklaas is discussing his latest book, The Despot's Apprentice: Donald Trump's Attack on Democracy. https://t.co/l4GjeV8Av0Highly recommended reading for LSE100 students: @zeynep argues that flooding social media with disinformation is itself a form of censorship. In the era of social media, what constitutes free speech? #fakenews #democracy  https://t.co/9Vh8R6UtX3Our #LSE100Live event with @brianklaas is TOMORROW!

See you there! https://t.co/AUsQVZAisSInteresting development for LSE100 students to consider as we analyse the impact of 'fake news', misinformation and disinformation on #democracy: Facebook unveils plans to "remove clickbait and what it decides are low-quality news publishers." https://t.co/0Fcthukm6ZWe're pleased to announce our first #LSE100Live event of the term with @brianklaas discussing his new book, The Despot's Apprentice: Donald Trump's Attack on Democracy.
