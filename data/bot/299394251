The person in Aurora, Colorado that is trying to gain access to my Gmail account by attempting to "recover" it can fuck right off. I'd be willing to bet they are drunk and typing the address wrong, but they can still fuck off.Taking the plunge... https://t.co/Nwu5kuZ6gF@GMillerTSN So sorry to hear this Gord. My condolences to you and all of Brian's friends and family.I can hear Long Island Medium in the background. This depresses me greatly. Why do people watch that crap? Moreover... why does anyone believe the bullshit they spew?@jennafabulous  https://t.co/TWeinG8iRh@kelsylroberts This is something that absolutely MUST be filmed and put on YouTube. 😁😂@kelsylroberts When Vancouver finally does win one, every hockey fan I know personally that doesn't like the Canucks is going to have to take a week off work to let their face heal from all the peeling skin. That's how much I'm going to rub it in. 🤔😛😧😳🤕@kelsylroberts And as soon as Vancouver *does* win a Cup, the comeback becomes "win as many as my team has" instead of "win one".@kesrows It's really more of a brown lining... 💩💩💩@Domingues_19 @FamousGoalHorns So many bandwagoners....@Pucksonnetca  https://t.co/qWuVyULeoTNearing 20 minutes left in the Ducks season. This is the time of the year I'm most excited to watch Anaheim. Excited to see the look on Ryan Kesler's face when he doesn't win the @StanleyCup again. #quackquackSo excited for Wednesday night. I'll be able to continue the yearly tradition of watching Ryan Kesler not win a @StanleyCup. 😁😂@steeletalk One office I would not want to be a part of right now. Can only imagine how terrible they feel about this mistake. And what Parker Tobin's parents must be going through...@omarcanuck He obviously thinks FAR too highly of himself. Carter can suck it. Twins did even better after he left. Also, Alex Burrows says hi.@leahflame Anyone complaining about medical personnel making mistakes should try doing their job and see just how hard it can be. They made a mistake and corrected it as soon as it was discovered. The person that actually made it should get a slap on the wrist for sure, but nothing more.@_chamilton Totally speechless. I feel for all of the families and friends of the Humboldt team. Utterly tragic. 😧😭💔@RobTheHockeyGuy @glovesaveluongo Should be used sparingly though. Keep it for specific situations that don't come up too often. Overuse will kill it quickly.@FarhanLaljiTSN I'm not sure it really mattered, given what these two mean to this city and this province as both players and people. A Cup win would have been nice, but would ultimately be relegated to footnote status on a night like that. #ThankYouSedins@canucksprayoffs Vancouver, captured in cartoon form right now. #allthefeels#ThankYouSedins. Enough said.@Pucksonnetca I've already been crying enough after the twins final home game... I don't need to be shedding more tears after that massive burn 😂😂😂😂😂#getittogetherdave@lilireinhart @CamilaMendes @colesprouse @madelainepetsch So happy for you and the rest of the Riverdale cast and crew on the season 3 renewal. Can't wait to see where this show goes!@ryanbiech Adorable. Congrats Ryan! :)@LastWeekTonight Gladly! :)@snoopWORLDorder Plot twist: Marchand then misses 2018-19 season due to groin injury 😂@AmeliaMcCaffrey 😮😍😍😍😘@MizzzAlia That FB and that pizza company are spying on you?@JessicaCapshaw Sorry to see you go, Jessica. It's going to be weird watching Grey's without you there. :(@benkuzma Not sure what is more disappointing... This injury update, or picking 5th in the draft.WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!@FriedgeHNIC Thoughts on anything else coming Johansen's way? I'd say a fine for sure. #notcoolRyan@Rad_NikkiYVR Should be continuous sudden death OT. 20 minute periods, full intermission. Not like they'll be playing the next day when you're handing out medals...@SatiarShah They aren't wrong... It really is a miracle 😁😎@trishaa_hunterr We're Canadian. We can lose and still be classy. The officiating was horrible. USA got away with a LOT, CAN was handed a couple they didn't deserve but also got away with a few more. Hope it gets cleaned up for Beijing. Regardless, the US played a good game. Congrats on the win!@BrowntoBure Clearly not going to call anything for Canada here. Crazy.@AM730Traffic South.@AM730Traffic car sitting in the middle lane on Main @ National in Vancouver with its hazards on. Passed by a few minutes ago.@DineshDSouza In what world do those two things equate? Summer jobs versus watching their friends get shot and killed? Fuck you Dinesh. Fuck. You.@patersonjeff Was at the game tonight too. Had to drive home from the Scott Road Skytrain station. Boy was it ugly out there.@GradySas And just think... if Virtanen can develop into this kind of power forward too... :DThis cannot be retweeted enough. https://t.co/gTUGAV3YngSo glad I'm at this game...@imacSportsnet Kes all tbe way.@canucksprayoffs If this isn't the most liked tweet on Twitter by game time....@ryanjreilly I feel like there are more pressing matters... #badtimeforaslipup@EllenPompeo I already loved @EllenPompeo as an actress. She is quickly moving up my list of favorite people on Twitter too. #0FCKSGIVEN@Sweetfacefergie Almost sounds like that came out of a Rick and Morty episode :)@TeamHoman We still believe you can turn things around! #goTeamHoman #goCanada
