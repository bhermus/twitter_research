Their so-called "values" never existed to begin with and are only rhetorical tools to bludgeon others with or to hide behind. They are hypocrites, through and through.And it's working. We lose ground every day to a rising Christian autocracy the people fighting for it won't even live by. 

What an absurd situation.So follow along: Evangelicals don't live by their values in order to force non-evangelicals to live by evangelical values.Evangelicals support Trump -- the opposite of their "values" -- because he advances their agenda of basing law, policies and justice on evangelical principles.He never said which Wednesday.Watch by the end of the day, Trump pays Rudy Giuliani 130K to shut the fuck up.I wonder if anyone being chased by wolves has run past a sign with an inspirational slogan and noticed it or not.Jesus, the original incel.
