Usually, the problem with my to-do list is that I can't read at least one item because of my handwriting. Today, I can read all of the items; I just don't remember what one means. (PS: I made the list at 6am this morning.)@frrocketdan ❤️😢 https://t.co/WQrHk2Beca@DineandDish Nice!@DineandDish Typically 11:30-7:30.

One more thing: I think I'll stick to being pale.When your 3rd spray tan ever goes horribly wrong, you use google to fix it and try lemon juice, sugar scrub, coconut oil, scrub brush, hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, and windex (!) to no avail.You still have time to make this!

Also, I was really sorry to use them for baking...kind of wanted to stop what I was doing to fry them up!@christian_state Thank you! God bless YOU! Thank you for leading us closer to Christ...even via twitter. :)@christian_state You are right about this. When I have a question about the faith...I ask our 19-year-old (and have for years)! Embarrassing as a cradle Catholic, but my “formation” in the church in the 70s and 80s was nothing like what he’s had. He IS on fire for the faith!@EricaLeaKastner Thank you!@mattcashore My son texted me this afternoon to say he walked by you on campus. :) Brush with fame!!!@JonAcuff I would 100% press the button and ask the flight attendant to address the situation.
